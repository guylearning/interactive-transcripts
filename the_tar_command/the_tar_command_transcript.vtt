Hi there. Occasionally when you are using a

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.920
Unix system you'll find files in a strange

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.560
format. In other words the extension on them

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.865
might be something like some file dot tar

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:16.865
dot g z and you might say what

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:19.505
is that? Well, it's basically a zipped up

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.065
archive file. Basically it's just a zip file

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:27.265
that you can extract and it gives you

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:29.320
a folder or directory of files. So I

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.680
just wanted to quickly go over how you

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.920
would actually extract that from the command line.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.440
Here's how you do it, if you want

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.600
to extract something like that you type tar

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.160
which stands for tape archive, which is from

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.760
back in the day when we actually used

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.705
to use magnetic tape to store files and

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:46.505
do backups and so forth. And you type

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:51.225
tar and then the options dash XVF which

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.105
stands for extract and V stands for show

00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:55.545
me all the files you've extracted and F

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:56.825
stands for I'm about to give you a

00:00:56.825 --> 00:01:00.250
filename. And then, in this case I have

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.490
one called assign zero dot tar dot g

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.210
z and it will, untar the file for

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.465
you. Okay? And if you wanna actually create

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:15.465
a zip file like that, you could actually

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:19.625
use the zip command, which is also pretty

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.945
common. But if you wanna create this particular

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:26.390
type of compressed file, you would type tar

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.630
c z, which stands for compressed into a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.430
zipped form, and then v f, if you

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.590
wanna see all the files again, and then

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.185
a directory name and it will, oops, let's

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.905
see tar dot g z, a directory, a

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:45.505
filename and then a directory name and there

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.585
you go. And that's how that's how a

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.585
tar file tar command works. Thanks.
