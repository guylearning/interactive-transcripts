00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi there. This is a video on the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.280
history command and some other associated commands that

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.200
go along with your bash shell on the

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.235
Unix system. And I'm just going to show

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.395
you how to see some of the previous

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:19.195
commands that you've used and to actually use

00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:22.395
them efficiently. So if you type history, I'm

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:26.410
logged into the myth computer here. If you

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.610
type history, you can see that there lists

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.610
out all bunch of whole whole bunch of

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.730
different commands, about 5,000 plus commands that you

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.490
may have typed. And it keeps all those

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.635
in a little file that you are able

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:43.155
to access. So you can do that with

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.315
the history command. Some of the other interesting

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.075
things you can do, you can use the

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.635
arrow keys. So I'm right now typing the

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:51.955
up arrow key and if I keep typing

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.435
the up arrow key, it goes back through

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.420
my various commands and I can just keep

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.620
going back all the way. If I hit

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.300
the down arrow key, now I'm hitting the

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.460
down arrow key, it goes forward. So I

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.060
can go up arrow key, down arrow key,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.500
up arrow key, down arrow key, etcetera. And

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.580
then instead of having to go and type

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.385
command again because you'll end up doing that

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:15.545
many many times on the system, you can

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.225
just use the arrow keys to quickly go

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:19.305
back to the last command or the last

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:22.665
couple commands ago, etcetera. So that's one way

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.990
to get to your previous command. Another one

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.750
is to type the exclamation point, also known

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.230
as the bang character. Type the exclamation point

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.005
and then if you type a if you

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.765
type the exclamation point it actually just doesn't

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.285
do anything. But if you type the exclamation

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:43.645
point with a character, it will go back

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:47.805
to the character or the command that started

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:51.405
using that most recently used that starting character.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.680
So in fact, if you look 5,003 on

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.240
here, I typed the clear command. So if

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.280
I type exclamation point c, it will actually

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.320
type the clear command for me. Okay? That's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840
not the best example in the world, but

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.345
let's do let's do pwd. So if I

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:12.825
do exclamation point p, it will go back

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:15.625
and type the pwd command. So that's a

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.625
nice thing if you've run a previous command

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:18.985
and you know that the last command you

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:22.220
ran started with a particular character, you can,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.180
type that character there. Okay? So it's nice

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.900
to, to use, if you wanna go back

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.660
and you happen to know that you've used

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.460
that command recently. So that's a a nice

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.580
way to do it. One that I happen

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.085
to really like is if you type control

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:38.085
r, so I'm holding down the control button

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:41.685
and clicking r, it's a reverse search. So

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:45.125
if I start typing p, it will go

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.885
back and say, hey, look, p is p

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:48.565
w d is the last command that used

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.520
p and if I keep keep typing w

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.760
it'll continue in there. You can use the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.600
arrow keys to go back, I can type

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240
l, it happens to be the l in

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.840
clear, it's picking up first, but if I

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.120
type l s then it will go back

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.805
to the last l s command. Let's see

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:04.405
if I have there we go. L 0

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:06.805
7. I typed a space and it actually

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:08.005
fills it in for you and you can

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.285
go backwards relatively easy there. And in fact,

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:12.885
if I do now, if I do the

00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:15.525
right arrow key, I'm able to actually modify

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:18.380
the command too. So if I wanted to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.020
do something like that, I could and I

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.580
could change it. So those are a few

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.500
different ways to use the history command and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.484
you'll use them all the time to save

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:35.364
yourself time on the system. Thanks.
