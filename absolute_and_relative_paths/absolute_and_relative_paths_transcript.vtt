00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.960
Hi there. In this video we are gonna

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.240
talk about the difference between the absolute and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
relative paths when you are on a Unix

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.840
system. So as we've described before on a

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.680
different video, the file system is just a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.295
tree and the root path is slash and

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:24.455
all the directories for everybody who's using the

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.935
myth system or any, in fact, almost any

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:30.590
computer at Stanford has the files and directories

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.430
underneath that root. The absolute path of a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.630
particular file is the path that starts with

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.385
slash from the root and lists all the

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.865
different directories up to the particular file or

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.905
directory that you are looking at as, it

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:49.385
goes along. So, if we do a I

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:51.945
happen to be, in my home folder and

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.190
a subfolder called CS one zero seven. If

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.070
I type p w d that says slash

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.070
a f s slash dot I r slash

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.470
user slash c slash greg slash c or

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.990
g blah blah blah. All of that and

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.895
that is the absolute path of the file

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:12.575
or the folder. Okay, so if I look

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.135
in, if I go into assignments and then

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:20.095
assignment zero, assignment zero and hello, I can

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:22.975
type pwd and that will give me the

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:28.870
directory, absolute directory for the assignment zero folder.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.030
Okay, so if I was to actually do

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.550
the assignment zero folder and then hello, that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.945
would be the absolute path to hello. Okay.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.225
And there you go. And I've just run

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:44.225
that file hello from the absolute path. Now,

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:45.505
most of the time we don't wanna have

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.625
to type all of these paths because it's

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:50.945
a bit painful and we don't necessarily remember

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:52.545
what they are. But the nice thing about

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:56.640
Unix is that you are allowed to use

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.240
relative paths. So notice something, the path up

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.600
to here is just my home directory and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.080
we actually have a shortcut for the home

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.560
directory called tilde. So if I actually type

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:21.990
tilde cs107assignmentsassign0hello that's a relative path for the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.870
the hello program. Okay, so one way we

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.230
can use relative paths if we use the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.910
tilde sign to say look start at my

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.030
home directory. Another way is to use the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.925
dot and the dot dot files which we

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.205
already said stand for the dot stands for

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.005
the current directory and dot dot stands for

00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:43.285
the parent directory. So if I wanna say

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:46.930
dot slash hello, well guess what, that means

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.170
in my current directory run the hello program

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.490
and it works perfectly fine. Now what if

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.770
I was in the assign one folder, right?

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.370
Well this folder doesn't have hello in it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.595
but if I wanna run hello I don't

00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:03.155
have to type the entire path again nor

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.915
do I even have to start from my

00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:08.595
home directory path because I can just start

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.715
from here if I know that assign one

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:13.715
and assign zero are siblings of each other,

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.235
I can type dot dot to get to

00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.120
the parent directory and then I can type

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.720
assign zero and then hello and that's a

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.000
relative path to go from where I am

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.720
to the hello program. Okay and there you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.175
go. So you will use relative paths all

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:33.215
the time to refer to various places you

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.615
are. It's it's no fun trying to type

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:39.535
out the entire folder name from this giant

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:42.580
AFSIR business. It's just not not very fun

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.020
and 99.999% of the time, you don't need

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.740
to have an absolute path. Thank you.
