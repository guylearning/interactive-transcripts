data-start-time="1616.745" data-end-time="1626.345">So just as our AI can help Sam find a tractable way into this space, it can also facilitate connections to communities of practice, here suggesting

helped me think about them.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_55_1" data-start-time="1667.13" data-end-time="1673.8501">First, we bring guided learning to authentic contexts rather than thinking about it as a separate activity.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_55_2" data-start-time="1674.7151" data-end-time="1681.035">We're able to make that happen by imagining an AI which can perceive and act across applications on Sam's computer.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_55_3" data-start-time="1681.435" data-end-time="1689.435">And as the audio transcript at the end of the story here alluded to, that action can potentially extend to activities outside of the computer as well.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_55_4" data-start-time="1690.95" data-end-time="1703.27">The AI can give appropriate guidance in part because, with permission and executing locally, it can learn from every piece of text that has ever crossed Sam's screen, every action they've ever taken on the computer.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text" id="text-para_56" data-paragraph-idx="56" data-start-time="1704.8351"><span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_56_0" data-start-time="1704.8351" data-end-time="1710.995">It can synthesize scaffolded dynamic media so that Sam can learn by doing, but with guidance.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_56_1" data-start-time="1712.915" data-end-time="1718.915">And then, when explicit learning activities are necessary, we suffuse them with authentic context.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_56_2" data-start-time="1719.7699" data-end-time="1725.7699">The AI in our story grounds all of the reading and practice Sam's doing in their actual aims.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_56_3" data-start-time="1726.49" data-end-time="1730.0099">It helps Sam match the learning activities to their depth of interest.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_56_4" data-start-time="1730.8099" data-end-time="1740.7449">And it draws on important moments that happen while Sam is doing, like insights from that coffee meeting at the end or questions asked while implementing parts of the project.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text" id="text-para_57" data-paragraph-idx="57" data-start-time="1741.1449"><span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_57_0" data-start-time="1741.1449" data-end-time="1744.0249">And it brings those moments into study activities.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_57_1" data-start-time="1745.465" data-end-time="1749.225">Besides connecting these two domains, we can also strengthen each of them.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_57_2" data-start-time="1750.76" data-end-time="1756.9199">So our AI suggests tractable ways for Sam to just dive in to a new interest.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_57_3" data-start-time="1757.5599" data-end-time="1760.6799">And it helps Sam build connections with a community of practice.</span> <span

actually work.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text" id="text-para_58" data-paragraph-idx="58" data-start-time="1768.885"><span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_58_0" data-start-time="1768.885" data-end-time="1772.725">So our AI creates a dynamic vessel for ongoing reinforcement.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_58_1" data-start-time="1773.605" data-end-time="1778.99">It varies what's in that vessel over time so that knowledge transfers more effectively to real situations.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_58_2" data-start-time="1779.79" data-end-time="1781.79">And it doesn't just maintain memory.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_58_3" data-start-time="1781.87" data-end-time="1784.4299">It increases depth of understanding over time.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_58_4" data-start-time="1786.91" data-end-time="1790.1901">Now I'd like to give two cheers for chatbot

data-start-time="1791.0951" data-end-time="1796.4551">Most discussion of AI and education at the moment revolves around the framing of chatbot tutors.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_59_1" data-start-time="1796.4551" data-end-time="1807.49">And I think this framing correctly identifies something really wonderful about language models, which is that they are so good at answering long tail questions if the user can articulate the question clearly enough.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_59_2" data-start-time="1807.81" data-end-time="1815.4099">And if the user is trying to perform a routine task, chatbot tutors can often diagnose problems and find good ways to get the user unstuck.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_59_3" data-start-time="1815.65" data-end-time="1816.21">And that's great.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_59_4" data-start-time="1817.105" data-end-time="1825.345">But when I look at others' visions of chatbot tutors through the broader framing that we've been discussing, they're clearly missing a lot of what I want.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text"

fail to take seriously just how much a real tutor can really do.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_60_1" data-start-time="1831.44" data-end-time="1842.3999">Large part, I think that's because the authors of these visions are usually thinking about educating, something they want to do to others rather than learning, something they want for themselves.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_60_2" data-start-time="1843.515" data-end-time="1848.395">Now a sad truth about the world is that postdocs and graduate students are incredibly underpaid.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_60_3" data-start-time="1848.475" data-end-time="1853.0349">So it is actually surprisingly affordable to get an expert tutor for a technical topic I care about.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_60_4" data-start-time="1853.435" data-end-time="1861.26">But if I hire a real tutor as an adult to learn about signal processing, I will tell

data-end-time="1907.355">By comparison, the typical conception of a chatbot tutor lives in a windowless box, and it can only see whatever's provided on scraps of paper passed under the door.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_62_4" data-start-time="1907.675" data-end-time="1909.755">It can have no effect on the outside world.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text"

data-start-time="2601.545" data-end-time="2612.7449">So with my question, I was thinking about how with the AI, what you have is you like say that AI advancement will lead to some dystopian feature where we find people the knowledge and then we force them to know it.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_91_3" data-start-time="2613.0999" data-end-time="2617.98">But who's to say that that is still already happening to some extent with curriculum right now without AI?</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_91_4" data-start-time="2619.42" data-end-time="2622.14">Isn't necessarily a concern as much as other things, I think.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text" id="text-para_92" data-paragraph-idx="92" data-start-time="2622.14"><span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_92_0" data-start-time="2622.14" data-end-time="2630.9949">But beyond that, I think it's kind of like, because that problem can happen, like when we don't look at the root problem, it can happen in the most immersive learning.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_92_1" data-start-time="2630.9949" data-end-time="2639.6348">In ethnic studies class you can still end up restricting someone to that specific topic instead of connecting identity as much as you would in say a math class or something like that.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_92_2" data-start-time="2639.98" data-end-time="2665.985">So what if you could implement that like sort of, I guess to give another example of how in the other hand, you can do something really well, even in a math class, for example, if you look at the higher concepts or if someone explains it really well, or in like say neuroscience and those sorts of fields, there might be content that is above the cost that is interesting that would make someone more interested and able to learn the class themselves, especially if it connects to their own prior knowledge.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_92_3" data-start-time="2665.985" data-end-time="2674.6902">So what would you think if like, guess, how do you think you would implement this into like a learning system to take advantage of it like say Canvas?</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_92_4" data-start-time="2674.6902" data-end-time="2693.295">Do you think that you could do it in a way that you could customize in part assignments to synthesize the students' interests and the teachers' intent to teach people necessary content and teach people the content that they want to know in a way that they might be doing more, but ultimately less because it's easier for them if they know the context and can connect to it.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text"

the talk was part of a complaint about schooling in general.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_93_4" data-start-time="2708.54" data-end-time="2715.705">And AI doesn't necessarily make

smarts but not street smarts.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_110_1" data-start-time="3173.795" data-end-time="3176.2751">That's a great question.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_110_2" data-start-time="3176.835" data-end-time="3185.27">One of the inspirations for this talk was trying to exorcise myself of the young ladies illustrated

technologists is this book called The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, which depicts a sort of far future utopian learning environment.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_111_1" data-start-time="3199.815" data-end-time="3204.375">It's like a magical book that transforms a young girl's life.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_111_2" data-start-time="3205.07" data-end-time="3211.47">And one of the things that's interesting about this book that I think is underappreciated is that it is almost exclusively focused on street smarts.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_111_3" data-start-time="3211.47" data-end-time="3216.91">So this book teaches her martial arts and getting out of sticky situations and persuading people and so on.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_111_4" data-start-time="3218.805" data-end-time="3222.485">And I chose not to deal with any of that.</span> </div><div

data-end-time="3230.165">I think the way that I would handle much of that looks very different.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_112_1" data-start-time="3231.24" data-end-time="3235.32">And I'm afraid I haven't really thought about how I would handle that.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_112_2" data-start-time="3237.08" data-end-time="3241.8801">It's difficult to think about authentic practice of street smarts.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_112_3" data-start-time="3242.2" data-end-time="3244.2">Like what does that look like?</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_112_4" data-start-time="3244.2" data-end-time="3249.715">Is it like I'm going to go to a bad neighborhood and like look purposeful as I walk?</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text" id="text-para_113" data-paragraph-idx="113" data-start-time="3250.0352"><span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_113_0" data-start-time="3250.0352" data-end-time="3255.1553">And then but that's not exactly authentic practice because like you went to this neighborhood just for that purpose.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_113_1" data-start-time="3255.955" data-end-time="3258.2751">So I find myself confused thinking about this.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_113_2" data-start-time="3259.59" data-end-time="3278.395">And I find myself most comfortable when I think about people who enjoy practicing martial arts not as a kind of preparatory measure for imagined conflict in the future, but rather because they like the way it makes their body feel.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_113_3" data-start-time="3278.395" data-end-time="3280.3953">They like their community at the dojo.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_113_4" data-start-time="3282.3152" data-end-time="3291.25">And so if we start thinking about that, like, oh, it would be fun to do some exercise with others, then I think some of the same techniques can help.</span> </div><div

data-end-time="3298.2102">So you can probably use tools to help you find an appropriate community and perhaps to help you practice appropriately.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_114_1" data-start-time="3298.2102" data-end-time="3299.09">I play the piano.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_114_2" data-start-time="3299.775" data-end-time="3308.655">And that's not exactly book smart, but one can use practice systems, vessels for practice like I've described, to orchestrate piano practice.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_114_3" data-start-time="3309.055" data-end-time="3311.615">You can imagine extending that to martial arts.</span> <span class="transcript-sentence" id="sent_114_4" data-start-time="3311.615" data-end-time="3314.255">I don't know about other kinds of street smarts, but perhaps.</span> </div><div class="transcript-paragraph-text" id="text-para_115" data-paragraph-idx="115"
