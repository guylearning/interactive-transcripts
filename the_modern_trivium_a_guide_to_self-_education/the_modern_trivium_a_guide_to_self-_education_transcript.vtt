00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.080
Good evening, and gentlemen, and welcome to a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.160
new series, one I'm really excited about. I've

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.680
been kind of putting this off for a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.320
while, but I thought, alright. Let's just do

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.135
this. This is sort of a modern interpretation

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:16.855
of the trivia. And the idea here is

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:18.935
the modern education system, which I don't wanna

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.695
spend a lot of time criticizing, I've done

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:25.335
that before, it certainly has a different style

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.090
education than one would have received in the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.610
classical world or renaissance world, and there's a

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.970
lot of reasons to want to rethink that.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.410
Another aspect of it is for people who

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.355
either did not have the opportunity to have

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:44.595
an education or the kind of education they

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:48.515
want or were educated, went to college, but

00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:51.715
found that the education they received, while it

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.820
may have achieved some other goals, really didn't

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.380
provide what they wanted. And so I received

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.220
a lot of messages. In fact, the number

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.420
one set of questions and emails that I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.820
receive tend to revolve around this question. So

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.675
I thought, okay, at long last, here is

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:10.315
what I'm calling a modern take on the

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:14.395
trivium, and how to reconceptualize this and do

00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.475
this for yourself. So this is how can

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.915
one go about educating oneself in the modern

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.400
world, but within the context of how education

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.280
used to be done in the classical world.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.240
So that's the goal of of this series,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.400
and there's a lot there to go over,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.560
but I want in this first introductory section

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
is talk about sort of the background, what

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.955
this means, and why this might be coming

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:41.995
up so repeatedly as a topic, sort of

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:45.115
frame it. Then I'll get into more concrete

00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:49.515
aspects of this in the following lectures. So

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.560
to begin with, to understand that in in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.640
the classical world, and this is so this

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.760
is a mix of, you know, ancient Greece,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.440
ancient Rome, you know, Renaissance, Europe, and sort

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.360
of classical China. Those are sort of the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.255
models that I'm drawing on here, and a

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:08.935
little bit more about that in a second.

00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:11.495
But the idea was if you were getting

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:14.455
an education, you were an important person by

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:17.815
definition. And so the goal of the education

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:22.090
was allow you to express and use the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.330
power that you almost certainly were going to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.130
have. And the real core of it boils

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.810
down to a very simply simple to articulate,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.490
difficult to execute concept, which is to understand

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.895
yourself. If you think about man as the

00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:41.215
measure of all things, classical Greek claim, well,

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:44.255
this means that understanding yourself becomes core to

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.975
understanding other things, of course, because you're using

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:50.110
yourself as a yard stick. And second, then

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.270
to understand the world. So all you need

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.430
to do to give a classical view on

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.790
all this is to have a good grasp

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.350
of yourself and a complete understanding of the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.550
world. So, again, easy to articulate, a bit

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.425
tricky in execution, of course. However, this doesn't

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.985
mean that it is impossible. It just means

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:12.025
that it's, you know, it's it's always a

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.465
work in progress. This is never completed. And

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:17.705
so to address this and try to bring

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.460
these sorts concepts in the modern world, it

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.940
would be inappropriate. It would be sort of

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.940
a misrepresentation to simply say, okay. This is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.540
what they did in ancient Greece and or

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.980
this is what they did in in ancient

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.620
Rome. Just copy that because the context is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.165
so completely different that even if you did

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:37.645
exactly what they did you would not achieve

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:41.725
what I'm sort of having to guesstimate people

00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:43.885
are actually after which is sort of the

00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:47.400
results of the kind of education that was

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.360
being granted in those times rather than, you

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.480
know, a strict copy of precisely their methods.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.480
Although in some cases, let's just strictly copy

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.120
their methods where they seem appropriate. But some

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.560
of this just contextually makes no sense. For

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:03.195
instance, the notion, of course, if you were

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:05.915
in the ancient Greek world, being completely fluent

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:09.195
and and perfecting your ancient Greek really mattered.

00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:10.955
And similarly, if you're in the Roman world,

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.395
actually, the the the leaders of Rome spoke

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:15.915
Greek as well. So this is one of

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:18.150
their big distinguishers quality, but, of course, their

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.270
Latin needs to be very effective as well.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.030
So but and and then famously, of course,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.750
for a lot of times, the use of

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.645
Latin became distinguish or of someone who was

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.045
educated. So having a really high quality Latin

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:36.965
meant that you were super educated. Now that

00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:39.765
kind of model, it it just doesn't make

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:43.125
sense in the modern world. But learning English

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:45.780
actually would be more appropriate because Latin was

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.380
the language of power in the world, and

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.860
today English is the language of power, in

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.060
in one way to think about this. So,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.620
you know, just doing a rote copy makes

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.740
no sense. And so what I'm doing is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.505
trying to construct what those elements that I

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:04.905
think are most apposite for trying to achieve

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:09.145
RNs today. And to wit, I am drawing

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:12.825
on a sort of mix of the classical

00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:15.760
trivium and quadrivium, which I'll talk about. These

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.400
are the two classical systems of ancient Rome,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.160
obviously, from tri and quad. A smattering of

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.775
the Renaissance because the Renaissance introduced some some

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:28.335
more elements as civilization is progressing, as the

00:05:28.335 --> 00:05:31.455
context changes, becomes more modern, and a dash

00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:33.775
of Taoism, which I think is an important

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:36.815
element to add, particularly in the modern world

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:40.050
oddly, that Taoism has some some core educational

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.770
concepts that I think really do translate well

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.090
to the sorts of challenges we face today

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.290
that speak to some issues that were less

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.890
relevant in the classical era, but they still

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.155
talked about. So, note, this is this is

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.955
a mix, and this is sort of an

00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:01.955
idiosyncratic mix. Like, this is not again, I

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:03.875
could lay out the trivium and quadrivium for

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.315
you. No problem. Go, this is what you

00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:06.835
do. That would be very simple. You could

00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:08.915
look this up. It's not that complicated, but

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:10.360
I don't think this is what people really

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.520
want or what they're what they're interested in.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.000
So this is idiosyncratic though, so I wanna

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.640
I wanna underline that and not go like,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.560
this is what the trivium is. No, this

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.135
is a sort of application of the core

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:26.295
principles of the trivium as you can interpret

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:28.295
that in the world that we actually inhabit

00:06:28.295 --> 00:06:30.375
today as opposed to one from, you know,

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:34.615
two thousand years ago. Second, this is not

00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:38.020
the education I received. So this is an

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.020
important note like I'm not saying this is

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.660
the process that I went through I would

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.820
have loved to have gone through this process

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.020
however I was not raised in a house

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.340
that had books we didn't really do books

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.325
we really didn't do education, went to a

00:06:54.325 --> 00:06:57.605
series of sort of sketch educational institutions as

00:06:57.605 --> 00:07:00.485
I'm sure many of us did. I was

00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:02.965
fortunate enough to live at a time when

00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:06.400
I could go to college and support myself

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.440
working and so today I know this is

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.680
a ridiculous thought for people in The United

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.160
States at least, the notion that just just

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.400
working a sort of sketchy job or a

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.015
series of sketchy job that I had, you

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:19.695
know, worked at a hardware store, worked at

00:07:19.695 --> 00:07:21.695
a sandwich shop, I did odd jobs in

00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:25.615
the summer, know, that but but even doing

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:27.695
that I was still able to pay my

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:32.815
tuition and, you know, stay in school for

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.800
absurd number of years because I, you know,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.080
just kept going. But that is one of

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.640
the things that was fortunate for me. But

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.720
in doing this process, I just took, I

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.720
always took random. I took anything that I

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.975
thought looked interesting to me in the course

00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:49.735
catalog and because it was sufficiently affordable I

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.175
was able to do that as an undergrad

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:55.815
for five years and take just a crazy

00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:59.030
collection of courses under no sort of organizing

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.870
principle except for a while it occurred to

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.990
me that looked interesting in the course catalog

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.710
let's enroll in that. So I am not

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.710
claiming that oh I went through this system

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.270
and then this helped me you know produce

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.665
what I produce today because it's not true.

00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.625
There are core elements here that I wish

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:18.985
I had that I sort of feel like

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:21.225
I had to backfill for myself because I

00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:23.385
did not have the kind of background or

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:29.100
culture of learning that would have made this

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.500
much easier and much simpler for me. And

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.340
so the people I really want to speak

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.540
to, well I want to speak to everyone

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.140
of course, but really if you feel like

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.060
again you either got an education that didn't

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.460
fit you or that you didn't have that

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.620
opportunity, you know, maybe you're an immigrant, you

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.355
don't have the money, you don't have the

00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:46.675
language skills, all these sorts of things. Like,

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:48.515
this is what I'm trying to do is

00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:50.995
reconstruct a system and say, hey, you know,

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:53.155
there you the world is there. This is

00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:56.275
available to you. This sort of education is

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.480
possible, and and here's how to go about

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.520
doing it. And then finally, and this is

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.560
sort of the warning about this content, is

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.080
the problem with the classical education. Barzan speaks

00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:11.305
about this in other terms. If in the

00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:13.305
book House of the Intellect, if anybody's interested,

00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:15.305
lots of interesting things to talk about in

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.105
there from Barzan. Other thinkers have talked about

00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:21.465
this as well. How do you put this?

00:09:21.465 --> 00:09:23.590
Well, it's a it's you're going to be

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.070
alienated. It's an alienating process because in essence,

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.710
the kind of classical education that that that

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.230
you might be interested in and the kind

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.990
that was received in the ancient world in

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.510
the Renaissance was rare, it set you apart.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.095
And anytime you set yourself apart from your

00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:43.495
culture, what you're doing is you, to a

00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:45.735
certain extent, you're alienating yourself. So you may

00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:48.455
understand yourself better, you may understand your culture

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.535
better, but in the process of that, you're

00:09:50.535 --> 00:09:52.535
gonna make yourself strange. You're gonna make your

00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:55.220
culture strange, you're gonna make yourself strange. And

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.180
to the extent that you've inculcated the values

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.260
of your culture that you're about to interrogate

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.940
from a very different standpoint, you are alienating

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.900
yourself from yourself, from your learned patterns, from

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.555
your expectations. And so this is not a

00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:15.515
optional element. It is a necessary element. It

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:20.795
will have this setting yourself aside impact if

00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.795
you do pursue to choose to pursue this

00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:24.590
and the extent you choose to pursue it

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.510
this this is part of the impact that

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.870
will have. So it is it is a

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.830
discovery but it is one that does change

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.750
the way your outlook and will make your

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.070
outlook very different from considerably different from most

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.465
of the people you'll interact with most of

00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:45.625
the time. And again, this isn't a variable,

00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:48.265
or a maybe. It is to the extent

00:10:48.265 --> 00:10:50.825
that you're successful at this. It will absolutely

00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:54.370
be true. The flip side of that, as

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.810
I said before, is the the goal of

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.850
and the core of a classical education is

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.530
to understand yourself better, understand your world better

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.585
so that you can express your power and

00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:09.145
your potential. This is really it's very simple.

00:11:09.225 --> 00:11:11.545
It's not a complex sort of equation that

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.785
they that they drew up, but it's because

00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:15.945
if you were getting these types of education,

00:11:15.945 --> 00:11:18.425
you were already an important person or someone

00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:20.745
who had a real chance of being an

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.510
important person because these educations were unbelievably expensive

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.230
private tutors, lots of time, you know, you

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.910
had to travel to do this to get

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.150
your Greeks, people would finish in in Rome,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.675
you would send your your promising young sons,

00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:37.075
sorry, this is gonna be sons, off to

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:39.795
Athens just to learn, get their Greek perfect,

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:41.475
because you had really good Greek, that was,

00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:44.195
of course, now you're really someone important. And

00:11:44.195 --> 00:11:48.810
so the expense and time and hiring specialized

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.690
slaves or freemen who were who could train

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:57.530
you, it's unbelievably expensive. And so you were

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.690
assumed that you were going to be someone

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.445
quite important. And so when they were educating

00:12:02.445 --> 00:12:04.525
people, this was the idea. You're gonna be

00:12:04.525 --> 00:12:06.845
powerful or you already are. You're an important

00:12:06.845 --> 00:12:09.885
person. You're gonna be more important. And so

00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:12.365
that's how you wanna be educated. The education

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:14.845
of someone who's powerful, who's gonna need to

00:12:14.845 --> 00:12:16.900
understand themselves in the world so that they

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.940
can express that and and and exert control

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.140
over the environment in which they inhabit. So

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.980
that goal, you know, pled to the conquest

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.580
of the Roman Empire, which may be not

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.100
that great. But if we if if we

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.525
assume that we're not going to try and

00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:34.405
conquer the world, although, you know, it's up

00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.125
to you, you know, it is this notion

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:39.045
of trying to find the what's innate in

00:12:39.045 --> 00:12:41.765
you and being able to express and, you

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:46.380
know, make that those concepts, ideas, understandings, having

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.620
efficacy in the world in in a particular

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.940
kind of way that we'll talk about more.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.940
But that that's the goal. This is this

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.140
is what they were shooting for and sometimes

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.665
achieved. So with that background in, let's ask

00:13:01.665 --> 00:13:04.145
where we are, why do we feel alienated

00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:06.785
already perhaps or we feel dissatisfied with the

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.705
education, either we haven't had the opportunity to

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.200
receive or received an education that we feel

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.360
like whatever else it did didn't help us

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.520
with these core concepts. And one, it's easy,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.920
and I don't mean to criticize educational institutions,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.520
I've done that in the other series on

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.040
education, you can check that out if you

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.520
like, but there are just certain assumptions that

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.465
you can say okay these are just assumptions.

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:31.185
One, they're large systems, anytime you have a

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:35.105
large system they are by nature not geared

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:37.905
towards the individual, know sort of a slider,

00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:39.505
right, you have to do on average as

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:41.560
you have 20 students in class, you have

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.280
to set the class standard somewhere. You're either

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.400
going to set it too high and say

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.920
you're going lose some students on the bottom,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.800
you're going to set it too low and

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.640
you're going lose some students. Right? You know,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.120
all of these variables are complex and so

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.240
whatever your criticisms are, that is one problem.

00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:58.725
A bigger issue, I would say, besides that,

00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:03.605
is simply our current assumption that education is

00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:05.765
for jobs, that this is what you do.

00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:07.605
If you get an education so that you

00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:09.140
can get a job, you get a job,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.100
then, you know, life is good and everything

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.020
falls into place. Of course, we know this

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.020
is in practice, we know this is absolutely

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.140
not true, but in functionally, still believe it

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.980
and we act as if we believe it.

00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:23.765
And this has come about from a curious

00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:26.645
historical, this is one of your classic correlation

00:14:26.645 --> 00:14:31.445
does not equal causation moments in history. Because

00:14:31.925 --> 00:14:33.920
in ancient world, again all the way up

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.800
until very recently, if you had an education

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.760
you were by definition an important person. You

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.320
were either a scribe for the king or

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.960
a priest or maybe a lawyer or a

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.485
doctor and so it set you apart it

00:14:50.485 --> 00:14:53.445
made you into a sort of separate class

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:59.525
and so education correlated with power, authority, and

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:05.370
importance very directly. The link was not causal,

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.130
it was just correlative. And what happened as

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.090
economies grew, we moved in the Industrial Age,

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.275
maintained this truth was there, like, oh, look,

00:15:16.275 --> 00:15:19.555
the economy is booming in the Industrial Age.

00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:21.955
We have more educated people, and there was

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.675
this correlation of, you know, higher education societies

00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:28.800
had more booming economies. And so this correlation

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.200
got built into our minds that, oh, the

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.440
more education you get. The more education your

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.960
society is, the wealthier your society is, therefore

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.120
universal education is good, and so let's get

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.715
more education because that'll bring more economic growth

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:46.355
which will make your society better. And this

00:15:46.355 --> 00:15:48.115
flywheel got started. Now there are a lot

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.675
of other arguments for education by the way,

00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:52.435
this is just one that has come to

00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:57.970
absolutely dominate today. Then this got reversed, so

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.850
all these education people, pro education people and

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.930
pro economic people, has argued, look, education produces

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.810
a good economy, and so what slowly happened

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.170
is they said, okay, if that's true, then

00:16:11.355 --> 00:16:14.395
let's see the payoff. You say it does,

00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:17.755
it correlates strongly, so where is the payoff?

00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:20.475
We wanna see, so then what's the best

00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:22.875
amount of economic in return we can get

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:25.355
for the least amount of investment? See, once

00:16:25.355 --> 00:16:28.550
you make the economic efficiency argument, ah, well

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.070
now you're in this world of trade offs

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.110
and feedbacks. You know, oh, well if you'll

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.190
go to school for four years and get

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.310
this much benefit, maybe we can get almost

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.750
that much benefit if you're going to school

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.785
for three years, or two years, or one

00:16:41.785 --> 00:16:43.625
year, right? And so all this sort of

00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:47.785
efficiency and economic output and outcome has come

00:16:47.785 --> 00:16:52.345
to dominate the understanding of an education. And

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.945
it's very strange because much of it makes

00:16:55.945 --> 00:17:00.210
no sense once you investigate this. So, for

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.250
instance, if you have a bachelor's degree, and

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.610
this is in The United States for the

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:08.050
last twenty years from like 1995, '90 '4,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.650
'90 '5 is when this starts going up

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.155
to last year, to have recent statistics. If

00:17:14.155 --> 00:17:17.915
you have a college degree, your education, your

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:20.875
unemployment rate has averaged over the last twenty

00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:24.475
five years, thirty years, about 3%, give or

00:17:24.475 --> 00:17:29.910
take. The highest ever recorded was 5%. So

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.630
what this means is if you have any

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.710
college degree, your unemployment rate is going to

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.415
be pretty spectacularly low. Mean capping out during

00:17:40.415 --> 00:17:42.895
the great financial crisis at 5%, I mean

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.615
that's amazing. And you know you can take

00:17:45.615 --> 00:17:47.775
unemployment statistics with a grain of salt blah

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.375
blah blah, but and yet you know however

00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:52.990
you judge this that's pretty impressive. High school

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.750
is roughly double that. If you have a

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.270
high school education, your low is gonna be

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.950
average over those same times about 5.5%, high

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.510
unemployment is about 10%, again during the financial

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.725
crisis, so just about double that. If you

00:18:07.725 --> 00:18:10.045
have no high school education or you didn't

00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:13.725
graduate high school, it almost doubles again, so

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.605
your running unemployment rate's gonna be about 10%

00:18:16.765 --> 00:18:19.500
with a high of about 15% during the

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.460
great financial crisis. This is again all higher.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.820
By the way, if you're a minority, of

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.540
course, that will run those numbers up. So

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.900
what this tells us is having any education

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.405
is valuable from an employment standpoint. But, what

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:37.245
they keep trying to do is tell you

00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:39.965
that you have to have a certain education.

00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:43.245
So, it is better if you want to

00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:46.765
be employed, because any degree will give you

00:18:46.765 --> 00:18:49.820
this incredible boost in unemployment. Any college degree

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.860
is going to dramatically improve your chance of

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.420
employment and in fact even a high school

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.180
diploma will dramatically improve your chances of employment.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.220
So what does this mean? And this is

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.365
where I think we make this mistake, then

00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:08.405
the question is, what kind of employment do

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:12.725
I want? Right? If any degree, as we've

00:19:12.725 --> 00:19:16.965
just seen, produces really, really strong employment rates,

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.210
then the question is what kind of employment

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.010
do you want? What are you interested in?

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.090
And then to answer that question, so if

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.050
we're just talking about the most basic stupid

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.255
education equals jobs argument, this still doesn't help

00:19:35.255 --> 00:19:37.095
because what you have to then ask yourself

00:19:37.095 --> 00:19:39.655
is what kind of job would I like?

00:19:39.815 --> 00:19:41.495
And to answer that question you need to

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:44.295
know two things: you know drum roll please

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.720
who you are, you need to understand yourself,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.120
and you need to understand a lot about

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.000
the world. And so you end up even

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.480
if you just make the dumb assumptions about

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.600
education is for employment, you end up back

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.985
where you needing the answers that you would

00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:02.425
only be provided if you had a sort

00:20:02.425 --> 00:20:06.185
of classical style education because to understand the

00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:08.345
kind of job you would like and to

00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:10.745
understand you need to know who you are

00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:12.745
and you need to understand the kinds of

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:17.050
impacts variability and environments that you're likely to

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.810
work in in the world. And so this

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.770
seeming answer actually does nothing. It doesn't tell

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.330
us anything. It says, Oh, here's a bunch

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.170
of jobs, pick one that looks likely for

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.805
you, and then follow this course. And at

00:20:30.805 --> 00:20:32.885
the end of it, you'll get that job

00:20:32.885 --> 00:20:34.245
and then just shut up. And if you

00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:35.765
don't like that job, well, you made a

00:20:35.765 --> 00:20:38.245
mistake. The education system that didn't provide you

00:20:38.245 --> 00:20:41.365
with the background to understand yourself and the

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.045
environment that you might be working in, well,

00:20:43.045 --> 00:20:45.205
you can't blame them. It's your fault, right?

00:20:45.205 --> 00:20:50.860
Like, this the way it's constructed. Another aspect,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.620
so again, even if you make the most

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.820
base assumptions, you are right back to needing

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.220
to have the sort of background and understanding

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.815
that is core to a classical education. But

00:21:03.815 --> 00:21:06.455
even more serious, think, or at least equally

00:21:06.455 --> 00:21:10.775
serious, on this, is this increasing emphasis on,

00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:14.055
specialization, and that they want people to have

00:21:14.055 --> 00:21:16.520
increasingly specialized skills. By way this is both

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.440
for college, technical education, and trade education, right?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.240
Become an electrician, become a plumber, become an

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.440
HVAC person, become a dentist, become a dental

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.965
hygienist, become a nurse, know these narrowing, like

00:21:30.965 --> 00:21:34.005
the more specialized you are, the better off

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:36.165
you are, the more specialized your education, the

00:21:36.165 --> 00:21:39.045
better your outcome will be. Now this is

00:21:39.045 --> 00:21:42.160
a trick and it is absolutely counter. This

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.240
would be like the fundamentally most opposite kind

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.680
of education you could receive from a classical

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.400
education. And there's a couple of tricks here

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.520
that I want people to notice. One and,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.205
again, it's not that any of these specialties

00:21:57.205 --> 00:21:58.725
are bad, these are all great things to

00:21:58.725 --> 00:22:00.885
pursue if you want to, but here's the

00:22:00.885 --> 00:22:04.885
trick that happens quite often. And that is,

00:22:05.285 --> 00:22:06.645
if I can get you to get a

00:22:06.645 --> 00:22:10.485
specialized education, what this does is it transfers

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:15.410
the risk and the cost of a set

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.050
of skills from an employer to you. So

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.210
if I want to hire somebody who can

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.905
do HVAC, I can either hire somebody who

00:22:24.905 --> 00:22:27.145
seems like a pretty good person, hard working,

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.985
we can get along with them, she's going

00:22:28.985 --> 00:22:30.345
to do a great job, he knows what

00:22:30.345 --> 00:22:34.025
he's up to, and train them. Now I've

00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:36.345
taken the risk and I've taken the cost

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:39.310
on and I'm training you if I'm the

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.030
employer, right? Or I can get you to

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.590
do it yourself. So I can say you

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.230
go get those skills, you pay for them,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.345
you put in the time, and then if

00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:54.065
I need you, I'll hire you. And as

00:22:54.065 --> 00:22:55.505
long as I need you, I'll hire you,

00:22:55.505 --> 00:22:56.625
and as soon as I don't need you,

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.265
I'll just fire you. Or if the world

00:22:59.265 --> 00:23:02.305
changes and we don't need HVAC people anymore,

00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:04.065
now we need, you know, I don't know,

00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:06.610
something else, then you're out of luck because

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.010
now you have this very narrow specialized sets

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.050
of skills, which for whatever reason were in

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.530
demand ten years ago, aren't in demand today.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.170
This happens all the time. Certain specialties come

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.985
in to vogue, they go out of vogue,

00:23:19.985 --> 00:23:21.185
they're easy to get, they're hard to get

00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:23.905
right, this is all the swirling. And the

00:23:23.905 --> 00:23:26.945
trick for this kind of education, is you

00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:29.105
have a very narrow set of skills, and

00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:31.360
if you take the risk and invest the

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.600
time, and then the need for those skills

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.480
go away, ah, you're screwed. Now, if the

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.720
need for those skills go away after someone

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.280
else invested the time, after someone else took

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.975
the risk, that's different, right? You're like, okay,

00:23:45.975 --> 00:23:47.495
well I got paid, I learned a set

00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:50.455
of skills, okay, you know, the world didn't

00:23:50.455 --> 00:23:53.015
work out, that's fine. But notice where the

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:55.895
risk is being, who's taking on the risk.

00:23:56.375 --> 00:23:59.575
And that shifting is is, you know, historically

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.100
strange because it used to be if you

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.340
wanted to learn something you would be apprenticed.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.380
And the interesting things about apprenticeships were they

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.500
were generally indentured, so you had to work

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.980
for somebody for five years or seven years.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.220
And that is because you're learning a trade,

00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:18.715
which is valuable, and you're doing work for

00:24:18.715 --> 00:24:21.115
them, which is valuable for the employer, but

00:24:21.115 --> 00:24:22.475
at the end of it, you can go

00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:25.275
on and set up shop for yourself. So,

00:24:25.275 --> 00:24:27.435
the employers needed to make sure that they

00:24:27.435 --> 00:24:30.300
got their years service out of you, got

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.980
your value, so you were paying for your

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.380
education by working in all of this. I'm

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.460
not suggesting we go back to that system,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.780
but it does let you realize, like, oh,

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.060
back in the day, that the risk was

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.135
taken by the employer who was like, okay,

00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:47.295
I'm gonna exploit this person and beat them

00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:48.895
and be horrible in all kinds of ways,

00:24:48.895 --> 00:24:53.055
but at least you're getting something for your

00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:56.975
labor. In education now, the risk is very

00:24:56.975 --> 00:25:00.470
much on to the student. Classical education is

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.670
the other way around, not specialization, but generalization,

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.430
so that no matter what happened in the

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.670
world, no matter what happened in the environment,

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.470
you have some means of responding and you

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.695
have a broad set of skills that will

00:25:14.695 --> 00:25:18.695
allow you to adjust and adapt and continuously

00:25:19.015 --> 00:25:21.815
maintain your relevance and because you understand the

00:25:21.815 --> 00:25:24.870
world and you understand yourself you you don't

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.510
face this problem. So it strove to make

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.190
a, you know, classical in the in the

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.470
Renaissance period, they actually called it universal man.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.430
Right? A person of skills and outlooks and

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.495
insight that were universally applicable. Of course, this

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.415
is a very high bar. Would they meet

00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:44.015
it? Probably not. But this is the concept.

00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:46.815
It's like, oh, even if some specialty goes

00:25:46.815 --> 00:25:48.735
away or or some skill set is no

00:25:48.735 --> 00:25:51.710
longer valid, that's fine because I have a

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.590
deep base of learning and insight and skills

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.070
developed that I can pivot into some other

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.510
realm. And what they wanna say, and they

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.030
do say by the way, in the modern

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.235
world is like, Oh, that was back then

00:26:04.235 --> 00:26:06.635
when the world was less complicated. Today, the

00:26:06.635 --> 00:26:08.875
world is very much more complicated. So we

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:11.995
need these very refined, highly specialized people who

00:26:11.995 --> 00:26:15.610
don't have any other skills, who can only

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.890
do one thing because that's very efficient. Ah,

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:23.210
efficient for whom? It's efficient if you're a

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.170
large employer because when you need a specialty

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.530
you can hire it, when you don't need

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.370
it you can fire it, and because the

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.075
specialist is the one who's taken all the

00:26:31.075 --> 00:26:33.475
risk, you get all the benefit and none

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.235
of the risk. That's genius, this is very

00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:40.515
efficient for employers. For people, this is incredibly

00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:44.080
inefficient and incredibly risky, as we keep discovering.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.400
There's a reason people change careers now like

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.440
three or four times in an employed lifetime,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.520
is because of the incredible transformative nature of

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.320
the world in which we live. So, not

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.000
saying it's bad to have a specialized set

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.595
of skills, probably very good and often very

00:27:00.595 --> 00:27:04.755
fulfilling, which we'll get to. But this is

00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:07.875
not the same as saying, oh, don't have

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:10.435
the other. These are not mutually exclusive and

00:27:10.435 --> 00:27:12.275
this is the problem. It's like, oh, let's

00:27:12.275 --> 00:27:13.795
get rid of all that waste of time

00:27:13.795 --> 00:27:16.010
that we're spending giving people sort of a

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.450
more classically grounded sort of education, because what's

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.770
really efficient and where the big return is,

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.050
is in specialization. So those two notions of

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.575
who's taking the risk, make yourself way too

00:27:28.575 --> 00:27:33.215
narrow, is one problem with the modern system.

00:27:33.615 --> 00:27:37.215
And two is the notion that even if

00:27:37.215 --> 00:27:40.895
you buy all their arguments, you still can't

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.090
escape the need to understand yourself and understand

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.610
the world if you're gonna make any sort

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.370
of meaningful choice about what sort of career

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.090
or job or education that you want. Right?

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.505
It's sort of a necessary element which we

00:27:55.505 --> 00:28:00.305
tend to ignore. And so, what happens is,

00:28:01.345 --> 00:28:04.465
you end up in a place where, even

00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:09.110
though you might be educated, often people don't

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.350
feel like they got the education that is

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.070
serving them, because, oh, I went to a

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.670
law degree, I went to school for a

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.350
long time, I learned a lot, I read

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.030
a lot, I studied a lot, and yet

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.670
somehow I don't feel like I have a

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.430
full active life of the mind, I don't

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.865
feel like I'm integrated in an intellectual community.

00:28:25.865 --> 00:28:27.625
Don't you know, those things seem to have

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:30.745
escaped me. And this is why, because that's

00:28:30.745 --> 00:28:35.945
a different set of skills entirely. Another aspect

00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:37.705
of this, and the last aspect of this

00:28:37.705 --> 00:28:42.770
for the introduction, is the complete mistake that

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.490
we've made, pretty systematically I'd say, which is

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.425
the ancient world was very interested in power.

00:28:51.425 --> 00:28:53.985
Oh my goodness, were they interested in power.

00:28:54.305 --> 00:28:56.945
And therefore, they were somewhat interested in money.

00:28:57.905 --> 00:29:00.785
What's happened in the modern world, and modern

00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:03.985
cultural conception of the world, is there's been

00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:08.660
this incredible mistake, which is to equate power

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.020
and money. Right? Like, if you have money,

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.300
you have power. And this, of course, is

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.180
a an obvious and one would even say

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.455
trivial sort of why even bring this up

00:29:20.455 --> 00:29:26.055
kind of mistake. However, it is 100% core

00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:31.495
to the nature of our understanding of the

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:33.870
world is that we think that oh, if

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.910
you get more money, you have more power.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.550
And this is of course easily, it's just

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.350
not true. And so when you have an

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.785
education system that says, hey, if you get

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.945
a good job that makes good money, then

00:29:48.945 --> 00:29:52.305
you're in business because the money itself justifies

00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:55.825
everything else. See, this is another version of

00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:59.025
that mistake because it's like, oh, what people

00:29:59.025 --> 00:30:01.985
want, I would say on average, is not

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.790
so much money as the power that money

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.710
will deliver. However, money is a power and

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.910
money is a type of power, absolutely not

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.270
arguing that in any way. However, it can

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.185
only be seen as and be fulfilling when

00:30:18.185 --> 00:30:21.385
one understands power generally, what kind of power

00:30:21.385 --> 00:30:23.305
they want, how they're trying to act and

00:30:23.305 --> 00:30:25.625
behave in the world, what sort of impacts

00:30:25.625 --> 00:30:28.025
do they want. And the notion of just

00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:30.880
more money better, which is of course what

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.880
we're told ad infinitum, hence by the way

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.480
that if you look at the different careers

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.080
that schools tend to promote and talk about,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.280
they're consistently going oh well this one makes

00:30:42.525 --> 00:30:44.125
more than that and this is a higher

00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.045
paying group and this one is better job

00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:49.165
opportunity higher so like therefore better job equals

00:30:49.165 --> 00:30:54.525
higher paying job as opposed to understanding how

00:30:54.525 --> 00:30:56.870
do you want to express your power, what

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.870
is your power, how do you want to

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.790
make this active in the world. So this

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.950
concept of self expression, of self efficacy, by

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.230
the way power in this sense, I mean,

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.270
is the power to express oneself and make

00:31:10.765 --> 00:31:18.845
one's sort of views and desires real, to

00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:21.805
make them manifest, to fulfill them. There's a

00:31:21.805 --> 00:31:25.110
great passage in Plato where Socrates is arguing

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:29.590
with a guy, Socrates is just losing his

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.870
mind. I can't remember the name of the

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.670
guy, it should have just flew out of

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.790
my mind because it's one of my favorite

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:37.030
passages. Says, Socrates says, Well, what is the

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.470
good? And the guy says, Well, the good

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.245
is obviously to be able to do what

00:31:41.245 --> 00:31:42.925
you want to provide for you and your

00:31:42.925 --> 00:31:44.525
friends. Right? Like you, your friends, and your

00:31:44.525 --> 00:31:45.885
family, you take care of them, and then

00:31:45.885 --> 00:31:47.645
that's the good. And Socrates says, no. No.

00:31:47.645 --> 00:31:48.925
No. No. But what about wisdom? And the

00:31:48.925 --> 00:31:50.445
guy's like, I don't care about wisdom. It's

00:31:50.445 --> 00:31:52.605
good to have the power to be able

00:31:52.605 --> 00:31:54.365
to provide for your friends and your family

00:31:54.365 --> 00:31:56.470
and able to do what you want. Like,

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.870
this is the good. And what philosophical history

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.950
has done is because we idolize Socrates so

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.150
much, rightly so, and Plato, rightly so, but

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.710
we forget that really, no, that's a very

00:32:08.655 --> 00:32:10.895
argument right like this is actually the core

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:14.335
and it's and Socrates agrees on this oddly

00:32:14.895 --> 00:32:16.895
slight digression here of course on Plato and

00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:20.015
Socrates because what Socrates ends up arguing is

00:32:20.015 --> 00:32:24.030
that no it's wisdom that allows you to

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.230
express yourself and understand the world and therefore

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.910
have the power you want. Wisdom is the

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.270
path to power and the other guy is

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.190
saying well maybe but there's all these other

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.590
paths to power too. So they're arguing actually

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.430
about the same thing like where does power

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.265
come from? But so they were not confused

00:32:39.265 --> 00:32:41.185
about what they're trying to do. So if

00:32:41.185 --> 00:32:43.985
you wanna be a musician, the ability to

00:32:43.985 --> 00:32:46.225
play the music you wanna play, this is

00:32:46.225 --> 00:32:49.585
a type of power. And it's a very

00:32:49.585 --> 00:32:51.745
different type of power than someone who is,

00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:54.480
say, an architect wants to be able to

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.760
design and build things. Right? That's a very

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.600
different type of power that is gonna be

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.600
manifested differently in the world, it's gonna be

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.960
a different path, I mean, there's all these

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.840
different elements in that. But for instance, it

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.280
just popped in my mind, if I mentioned

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.235
an architect, maybe a good example of this,

00:33:09.235 --> 00:33:12.195
maybe not, we'll find out, is, you know,

00:33:12.195 --> 00:33:13.795
people go to architect school and they want

00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:15.635
to, I would say, on average they want

00:33:15.635 --> 00:33:17.555
to design and build things and see them

00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:20.195
in the world. Very laudable, very human, very

00:33:20.195 --> 00:33:24.090
basic instinct. But if you end up at

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.170
a firm that does big things and you're

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.330
at a desk and you're scribbling all day,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.170
and you might be making good salary, you

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.530
might be getting promoted, you might be doing

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.930
all the right things, but you're starving because

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:37.465
you're not expressing the fundamental power, the fundamental

00:33:37.465 --> 00:33:39.385
power, like, no no no, I actually wanna

00:33:39.385 --> 00:33:42.025
see the things I designed, built. I said,

00:33:42.025 --> 00:33:45.545
see, that's different. You didn't probably go into

00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:47.545
architecture school, maybe you did, saying I wanna

00:33:47.545 --> 00:33:50.690
sit behind a computer all day doing drafts

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.050
of some sort of structural integrity thing for

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.050
some big company and I will never ever

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.130
see one of these things come to life

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.210
and I'll never be the person designing them.

00:34:01.995 --> 00:34:04.795
It might be vastly more gratifying to go

00:34:04.795 --> 00:34:07.915
to architecture school and build crazy shit on

00:34:07.915 --> 00:34:09.915
the beach out of driftwood than it is

00:34:09.915 --> 00:34:12.635
to work in a big firm in a

00:34:12.635 --> 00:34:15.355
high rise building with air conditioning behind a

00:34:15.355 --> 00:34:17.840
computer. Now, that might be great too, you

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.640
might love that, but right, so what the

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.880
kind of power you're trying to express really

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:28.160
matters and understanding that really matters. And so

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.440
what we've done is we've collapsed this in

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.135
the modern education system and said, oh, if

00:34:34.135 --> 00:34:37.815
you have money, which equals have steady employment,

00:34:38.215 --> 00:34:40.055
then you will have the power that you

00:34:40.055 --> 00:34:41.895
want and therefore you can do what you

00:34:41.895 --> 00:34:44.775
want. The problem is this assumes that everybody

00:34:44.775 --> 00:34:47.300
knows what they want, everybody knows that money

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.220
delivers that, and if they get money, they

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.580
know how to spend it so that they

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.180
will be happy and their lives will be

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.460
fulfilled and their and their capacities will be

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.835
expressed and recognized. Obviously, this is a non

00:35:00.835 --> 00:35:03.875
starter. Right? This is, again, an obvious falsehood

00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:05.635
that doesn't need a lot of reflection to

00:35:05.635 --> 00:35:08.995
to help us recognize that, yeah, this does

00:35:08.995 --> 00:35:11.155
not work. I mean, fact, my my favorite

00:35:11.155 --> 00:35:14.275
current example of this is, the degree to

00:35:14.275 --> 00:35:18.630
which we've inculcated these values that that that

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.910
just if if you have the money, then

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.950
everything will be fine is the obsession. I

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.105
mean, like the the obsession again, which I've

00:35:28.105 --> 00:35:30.985
mentioned before in the art world with the

00:35:30.985 --> 00:35:33.065
price of art. If you see art ever

00:35:33.065 --> 00:35:36.345
reported on in the in the general press,

00:35:36.345 --> 00:35:38.825
it is almost all either got stolen and

00:35:38.825 --> 00:35:39.945
then they'll say how much it was worth

00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:42.320
when it was stolen or something goes to

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.920
auction and they say, oh, this is gonna

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.160
get this much money. And so the whole

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.440
metric of the world of art becomes equated

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.760
with money and then the power of art

00:35:53.715 --> 00:35:55.795
becomes equated with the power of art to

00:35:55.795 --> 00:36:01.235
make money which, again, is just this, like,

00:36:01.395 --> 00:36:05.475
bizarre never never land of misunderstanding of the

00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:07.630
nature and history and development of art and

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.870
how it influences our lives and just every

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.710
other aspect of that's possible. But what happens

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.870
then with art education is that becomes sort

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.150
of art employment education which is probably just

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.790
simply not art education at all in a

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.365
lot of ways. And so, when you think

00:36:25.365 --> 00:36:28.165
about where we are, I think it's important

00:36:28.165 --> 00:36:31.365
to note that the entire structure and nature

00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:34.840
of our education system is to prepare people

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.360
for employment because we've made these mistakes about

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.640
what gives us power, where it comes from,

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.400
how we might experience it, and the entire

00:36:46.775 --> 00:36:51.095
impetus therefore is the opposite of what a

00:36:51.095 --> 00:36:53.575
classical education is. So we'll turn to that.

00:36:53.575 --> 00:36:55.415
Now in the liberal, the quote unquote, the

00:36:55.415 --> 00:36:58.055
original meaning of a liberal education was an

00:36:58.055 --> 00:37:01.050
education for a free person. And what they

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.570
meant by a free person is a, not

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.730
a slave, but also someone who is free

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.530
to choose whatever they wanted to do, or

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.490
at least free ish. And if you think

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:13.450
about it in those terms, like any sense

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.945
of studying for a particular outcome other than

00:37:17.945 --> 00:37:20.825
your own pleasure, own interests, own pursuit of

00:37:20.825 --> 00:37:24.265
what you think is important, is a betrayal

00:37:24.665 --> 00:37:30.210
of a liberal education. And so again it's

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:36.530
hard to articulate how unbelievably different the approach

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.890
was in its core assumptions and its core

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.735
motivations. And so when I say this is

00:37:42.735 --> 00:37:45.215
going to be an alienating process, that's what

00:37:45.215 --> 00:37:48.495
I mean. You're having to unlearn the sort

00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:52.095
of complete outlook that says that these things

00:37:52.095 --> 00:37:54.975
are functional for other than your own personal

00:37:54.975 --> 00:37:58.175
use. These things that the pursuit of education

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.590
is to get, you know, get money, get

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.870
money, more money, more efficiently equals more better.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.870
Right? Those sorts of assumptions simply, they have

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.950
to go away. And it's easy to articulate

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:12.230
them this way and you go, of course,

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.005
that's silly and we know this isn't true,

00:38:14.005 --> 00:38:16.645
but boy are they inside. And you'll run

00:38:16.645 --> 00:38:20.165
into them consistently. And finally, this is in

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:23.445
no way to say that there's, again, anything

00:38:23.445 --> 00:38:26.405
wrong with the specialization of, you know, we

00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:28.005
do need jobs. We do live in a

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:30.290
world where, you know, making a living is

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.690
a thing and we should not be alienated

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.090
from that process. And that's what I think

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:38.530
the most bizarre outcome of our current system

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.815
is, is that it makes something that could

00:38:42.815 --> 00:38:46.975
be great alienating, right? Because we misunderstand what

00:38:46.975 --> 00:38:49.215
we're doing, feel often people feel suckered into

00:38:49.215 --> 00:38:50.575
it, they feel like they don't have many

00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:53.375
options. This is, by the way, is one

00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:54.495
thing not to feel like you have many

00:38:54.495 --> 00:38:57.550
options if you don't have much education, you

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.310
know, because you maybe you don't, maybe they

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.950
are limited, but the more you understand the

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.110
world, the more background tends, the broader those

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.950
opportunities tend to be. But the narrowing of

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.845
specialization creates this kind of crazy world where

00:39:10.845 --> 00:39:14.685
highly educated people feel very trapped, which is

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:17.485
the opposite of a liberal education which is

00:39:17.485 --> 00:39:20.685
by definition supposed to free you, right? The

00:39:20.685 --> 00:39:22.445
degree to which you feel trapped is the

00:39:22.445 --> 00:39:25.005
degree to which you have not gotten basically

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:28.340
a good education. A good education is designed

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.060
to make you feel free, make you feel

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.500
powerful, make you feel efficacious at all times.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.980
Is one way to read that, if you

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:42.085
understand yourself and the world. And so it

00:39:42.085 --> 00:39:45.205
is the example of we live in a

00:39:45.205 --> 00:39:47.685
world where we have people who are obese

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:51.365
and malnourished which is an impressive achievement right?

00:39:51.365 --> 00:39:54.405
Starving and malnourished no problem. Obese and not

00:39:54.405 --> 00:39:56.680
mal nourished, that's easy too. But to be

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.640
obese and malnourished, I mean that takes some

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:07.160
real amazing cultural wrongness to achieve that. However,

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.125
think about this in terms of education: that

00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:11.605
we have a lot of educated people who

00:40:11.605 --> 00:40:15.765
feel really trapped, who feel very much enslaved

00:40:15.765 --> 00:40:19.285
to a system, which is to say that

00:40:19.285 --> 00:40:21.925
what they think of as education and how

00:40:21.925 --> 00:40:27.330
they've been educated is really the polar opposite

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.930
of what the ideal of education in the

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.890
classical world, which was nothing if not a

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.645
desire to not be a slave. How do

00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:38.885
I free myself? How do I free my

00:40:38.885 --> 00:40:41.925
mind so I can understand the world and

00:40:41.925 --> 00:40:44.725
myself, so that I can express myself and

00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:49.970
my capacities to the fullest extent possible? That

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.730
was the concept. This was the idea. And

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.050
so, when we find ourselves in a world,

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.810
I was just reading articles in preparation of

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.890
this for the people who are like, Google's

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.890
going through a rough patch apparently, making all

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.395
the money in the world, but the people

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:05.155
who are working there are unhappy, they don't

00:41:05.155 --> 00:41:07.395
feel compensated, they feel nervous about their jobs,

00:41:07.395 --> 00:41:09.395
they feel miserable, they feel overworked. This is

00:41:09.395 --> 00:41:12.915
sort of going downhill ish. One, first world

00:41:12.915 --> 00:41:14.595
problems like, hey, you're working at Google, you're

00:41:14.595 --> 00:41:16.515
making plenty of money, maybe shut up. But

00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:18.460
think about what this means too, These are

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.700
highly educated, highly motivated by all standards of

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.220
our culture, highly successful people who feel miserable,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:30.380
unhappy, trapped, and don't like their jobs. Which

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.475
is to say, they don't understand what education

00:41:32.475 --> 00:41:35.275
is for. Because if you feel miserable and

00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:38.315
happily entrapped, the ancient world would say, well,

00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:40.475
you got a bad education, because that is

00:41:40.475 --> 00:41:45.300
the definition of a bad education. So, this

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.460
is a process of how to begin to

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.180
redress this. How do we begin to re

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.020
educate our minds to do this ourselves, so

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:59.220
that we can increasingly and more fully express

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:02.115
ourselves. And again, this is not a purity

00:42:02.115 --> 00:42:04.755
process, Like we're not magically going to transform

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.995
everything, we're never gonna have to do anything

00:42:06.995 --> 00:42:09.235
we don't want, It's all that nonsense. No,

00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:11.475
this is just a process of how we

00:42:11.475 --> 00:42:14.570
go about and why we go about learning

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.530
or relearning or unlearning all the steps. By

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.210
the way, unlearning the hardest of the steps

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:23.290
to unlearn something is just brutally difficult. So

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:25.305
that we have new thought patterns and new

00:42:25.305 --> 00:42:29.145
outlooks that allow us again to understand our

00:42:29.145 --> 00:42:31.865
world and ourselves better because that is the

00:42:31.865 --> 00:42:36.752
real goal. So, conclusion to introduction. Part one

00:42:36.752 --> 00:42:38.992
will come very soon, will be an introduction

00:42:38.992 --> 00:42:42.672
to the Trivium, Step one Literacy. Thank you

00:42:42.672 --> 00:42:43.152
very much.
