00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi there. This is Chris, and today I'm

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.000
going to show you how to log on

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.360
to the NIF computers, which are the set

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.960
of computers we have in the basement of

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.255
Gates and the computers that you're gonna use

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.415
in the lab, but, you're going to use

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.535
for all your other programs as well. And

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.655
you're gonna log in, remotely using your own

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:26.215
computer. So we're gonna use a program called

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:29.280
the terminal, which is a program built into

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.680
your Mac that allows you to, get to

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.600
the file system of your, Mac directly. And

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.200
it also has a program that allows us

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.480
to connect to, other computers, namely in this

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.320
case the Myth computers. What you're gonna do

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.225
is you're gonna go up to the top

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.145
right up here and you're gonna click on

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:49.065
the little spotlight icon or you can just

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:53.945
type command space to actually bring up the

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:57.190
spotlight search. And if you type terminal, this

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.990
will bring up the terminal program which you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.590
want. What I normally do because I use

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590
it all the time is I right click

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.150
or control click on the terminal down here

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.750
and I go to options and I just

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.145
say keep in dock and that will keep

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.185
it in the dock so I don't ever

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:12.945
have to find it again, it's just always

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:15.665
gonna be there. So here's what we do.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.305
This is the inner workings of your Mac

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.545
right here. But we're gonna use a program

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:25.520
called SSH and we're going to type SSH

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.800
and then you're going to type your SUNET

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.280
ID, mine happens to be CGregg, then you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.120
type the at symbol and then nif. Stanford

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.715
dot edu. In fact, if you're on the

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.955
Stanford campus, can leave off the stanford.edu.cgreg@myth will

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:45.875
work just fine. When you type, return, then

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.275
it asks you, are you sure you wanna

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.275
continue connecting? This is the only time it

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:51.820
will ask you that. If you answer yes

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.500
now, it will never ask you that again.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.540
But then it will bring up a prompt

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.940
for your password. This is going be your

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.740
SUNET ID password. And, I'm going to type

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.675
it here and you'll notice that as I'm

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:09.955
typing it, in fact, I'm typing right now,

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:12.115
nothing is showing up. And this is a

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:14.115
security feature so that you can type your

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:15.795
password and nobody can look over your shoulder

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:17.890
and actually see it. But after I type

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.770
my password, I hit return and it logs

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.010
me in. In this case, it logged me

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.530
into myth seven. It chooses one of the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.770
myth machines and log you into it. It

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.485
doesn't actually matter which machine you're in, but

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.485
we logged on in this case to myth

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:38.085
seven. And now that you're in, you can

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:41.765
have access to your folders. One of the

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:43.685
a couple I'll do a couple key commands

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.090
here and then in other videos, we'll go

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.450
through some of the key commands in more

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.410
detail. But one is the, l s command.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.090
Actually, first first one I wanna show you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.890
is the c d command, which is c

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.305
d, which means change directory. And the c

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.985
d command will change in directory. I happen

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.425
to have a directory called one zero seven

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:08.625
built already. And, it changed the directory into

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.105
that directory. Notice something here. There's a little

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.830
tilde sign. By the way, my prompt may

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.470
look a little different than your prompt. It's

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.950
very easy to change it to look similar

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.790
to this, but it gives you the directory

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.950
that you're in, which is kind of nice.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.390
Nice to know that you're in the one

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.665
zero seven directory right now, which is on

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.585
my own, in my case it's on my

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.945
home folder. And, I just used the c

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.265
d command to actually move into that folder.

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:40.065
The other a couple other commands, l s

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.000
lists all the files that are in your

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.680
folder. I happen to have one, two, three,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.880
four files in the folder. L s dash

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.040
l will list all the files, and some

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.800
other information about them like how big they

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.925
are and so forth. It will also tell

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:56.925
you if they're directory. So for instance, these

00:03:56.925 --> 00:03:59.485
three files here are all directories because it

00:03:59.485 --> 00:04:01.245
has a little d there and I can

00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:04.525
change into the assigned zero directory as well

00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:07.720
and do that. So so that's the cd

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.440
command. If you want to get back to

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.200
your home directory, the easiest thing to do

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200
is just type cd enter and it will

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.640
take you right back to your home directory.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.880
You could also type cd tilde if you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.015
wanted to. Your home directory is located on

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:24.615
the AFS file system, which is Stanford wide.

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.095
In fact, if you type p w d

00:04:27.095 --> 00:04:30.135
for print working directory, you will actually show

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:32.615
it shows you your entire path, which is

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:34.830
all the way to you. This happens to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.510
be mine, right here and, everybody at Stanford

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.830
has one that looks like this. No matter

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.070
which myth machine you're logged on to, you

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.710
will be using the same file system. So

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.710
it's, it's kind of nice in that regard.

00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:49.845
A couple other quick commands you might wanna

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:53.205
know, the clear command will clear your screen,

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:54.965
which is kind of nice if you want

00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.285
a nice clear screen. If your screen gets

00:04:57.285 --> 00:04:59.605
screwed up, like the colors are weird or

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:01.285
there's weird characters on it, you can actually

00:05:01.285 --> 00:05:04.060
type reset, which will clear the screen in

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.940
a slightly more, low level fashion. Alright. So

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.700
now, what do you do if you wanna

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.540
log out? It's pretty easy. You just type

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.020
log out or you type, you hold down

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.980
the control key and type d and that

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.345
will log you out. If you just type

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:21.425
log out and then enter, that will log

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:23.665
you out. And that's all there is to

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:24.865
it. Thanks.
