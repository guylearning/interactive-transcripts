00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi there. This is a quick little video

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.520
on the backup directory that is provided with

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.160
the MIF system. This is not something that's

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.800
on normal Ubuntu systems, although you can install

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.255
things like this, But this is something that

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:20.375
the CS department provides to or I guess

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:24.855
the the university provides that gives you a

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:28.630
backup of the files in your folders. Now

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.990
this isn't the back this is not the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.910
kind of backup like Dropbox where it saves

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.230
all revisions of your files for many, many

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.310
days. No, it saves one revision which is

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.895
backed up nightly. So if you come in

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.535
to do your work and you're working along

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:47.015
and you accidentally delete a file, if the

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.735
file was present in the system yesterday, it

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:53.800
is probably in your backup folder. But you

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.160
can't go and say, oh, well, two days

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.600
ago I had something that was that I

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.040
changed yesterday, but I wanna go back to

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.640
the two days ago version. That's not gonna

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.160
happen. If the backup runs and the file

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.240
has changed when the backup runs, then that's

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.775
the one copy you get until the file

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:13.055
changes again and another backup is run. But

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.975
anyway, it's easy to get to your backup

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.095
folder from your home directory. So if we

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:19.455
c d into our home directory, I'm on

00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:21.055
the Myth computer here, and then we c

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:22.815
d into backup or I could have just

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:26.810
typed c d tilde dot backup. Okay. Notice

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.730
I'm in the backup directory and it happens

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.610
to look very similar to all of the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.450
files that are in my regular directory. If

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.770
I go back to my home directory, type

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.250
l s, it's basically basically the same files.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:42.685
But, the backup directory is a directory that

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.845
is, as I said, basically one day old.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.445
So actually yesterday I think I had my

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:52.205
c s one zero seven folder called one

00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:55.210
zero seven, so it's not hasn't updated today.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770
So that's that. But if we look in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.650
it, actually, if you look at the files,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.250
I don't believe you're actually able to remove

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.050
them. Test dot c. Yep. It says a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.915
read only file system. In other words, you

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:11.555
can look but you can't modify anything in

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:14.035
your backup. But again, is just simply for

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:16.915
backup purposes. If I happen to want my

00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:20.595
test dot c program to be, to go

00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:22.540
back into my home folder, I could copy

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.380
it back in c d c p test

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.100
dot c into my previous folder and then

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.900
I've got my backup. So anyway, it's just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.420
a way to, say, okay, there's some backup

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.605
capability in case the system crashes or in

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:40.925
case your computer dies or you accidentally remove

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.605
a file. That's probably the biggest reason. If

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:47.405
you accidentally remove files from your folder or

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:49.405
from your directory that were there yesterday, you

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.645
can get them back. Alright. Thanks.
