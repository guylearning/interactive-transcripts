Hi there. In this video, we're gonna talk

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.480
about a couple of commands that are useful

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.720
if you're doing a lot of moving between

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.360
directories and you want to go back to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.075
a directory you were recently in. So the

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:17.435
commands are actually called push d and pop

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:21.035
d. And by the names, should recognize that

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:25.275
they're basically stack based commands. And here's how

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.330
you use them. You say push d to

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
a particular directory. So let's say I wanted

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.090
to go for some reason back to my

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.210
home directory. Right. I would type the tilde

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.970
command, push d. And it would what it

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970
would do is it would actually move me

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.115
to my command or to my home directory,

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:47.755
but it would save on this stack the

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:51.115
directory that I just came from. So basically,

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:53.195
it would save the assigned zero directory and

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:54.715
say, you ever wanna get back to that,

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:57.380
I'm keeping track of it. So in that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.860
case we can actually cd to other places

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.980
too, cs one zero seven, cd old, whatever

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.740
and if we type pop d it pops

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.660
the last one off the stack which happened

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.420
to be assigned zero and it takes us

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.515
back to assigned zero. So if you're in

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.435
a particular directory and you want to move

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.795
to another directory to do some work, but

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:19.915
you want to come back to this one

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.795
eventually, just instead of doing c d, type

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:25.755
push d to push the directory and go

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:27.220
there. And of course to stack so you

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.340
can push as many as you want on

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.100
there. Push d to the home directory and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.380
then push d to cs 107 old etc.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.700
And then pop d will take us and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.295
then let's actually change whatever reason to CS107.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:48.295
Popd will take us back to assignment zero

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:51.015
and popd again will take us back to

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:55.030
sorry, popd originally took us back to the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.870
home directory and then pop d again will

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.310
take us back to the assignment zero directory.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.430
And that's the two commands. Now another one

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.470
that I like to use all the time

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.685
is related command and if I type c

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.005
d tilde to go back to my home

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.525
directory and then I wanna go just back

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:14.605
to the last directory, I can type c

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:16.285
d minus and that will go, hey, go

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:18.547
back to the directory you were just in.

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:21.587
So I use that one fairly regularly as

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:24.627
well. And that's push d and pop d

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:26.627
and also c d minus. Thanks.
