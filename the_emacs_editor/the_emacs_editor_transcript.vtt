00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi there. This video is going to be

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.600
a very quick introduction to the Emacs editor

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.760
which is one of the standard editors on

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.080
the NIF system and in fact most Unix

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.800
systems. It's a very old editor but it

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.735
has a ton of functionality once you get

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:17.655
used to using it. There's definitely a learning

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.335
curve to using Emacs but it's, once you

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:23.015
learn it, you can do lots and lots

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:25.495
of different things. Now you may have to

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:27.255
bear with me in this video because I

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:31.860
am not an Emacs user myself. I use

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.060
VIM primarily, so I may not understand quite

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.420
some of the commands I'm about to try

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.220
to show you. But we will do the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.380
best we can the best we can with

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.365
this. So if we type emacs and then

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:48.805
hello dot c will open up the file.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.965
You can go around the file with the

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:53.445
arrow keys, you're already ready to type, you

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:56.165
can just type something else, print f and

00:00:56.165 --> 00:01:00.550
then hello one or something like that. I

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.230
think if you wanna set it so that

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.950
it makes your indentation four characters, you have

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.070
to do that in a settings file. And

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.555
then you can, you can, just do the

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:13.875
change, make the changes you want and save

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:18.035
it. How do you save in Emacs? Well,

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:22.595
you do, you use what we call the,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.050
actually in this case I believe use control

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.170
to save. So it's actually control x and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.330
it'll say what the command that you're starting

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.810
down here is and control s will save

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.865
and that's how you save. To quit, you

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.785
do control x control c and you can

00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:46.185
quit like that. So let's open it back

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:48.105
up again and notice that I did save

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:50.825
my work here and I can just go

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.650
and delete that if I want to. There

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.330
is a command to delete the entire line,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.250
I just don't know what it is. But,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.570
you'll notice up here that there is a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.130
menu bar, up here like this and, it's

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.570
it's a little weird, that should not have

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.330
scrolled, but it's a little weird because there's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.855
no way to use the mouse if you're

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:10.975
SSH ing in to do this. Actually there

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:12.975
may be, but, in this I don't know

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:14.895
exactly how to do this, to do that.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.015
But what I do know is if you

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:18.175
type the f 10 key and in my

00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:19.855
Mac I have to type function and then

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:22.810
f 10, it, brings up the options and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.410
you can see down here it says, if

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.610
you wanna do, any of these various, things

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.890
you can do that. So if I type

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.490
o, it'll get me to option, it'll say

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.050
highlight active region, etcetera. If you ever get

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.490
in the middle of a command and want

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.395
to back out of it, control g will

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:39.635
go and go quit and go back to,

00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:42.915
where you were before. So let's say I

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:46.195
want to, add line numbers to this. There's

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:52.200
another control key or another modifier key kind

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.680
of like control called the meta key. On

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.920
my Mac it doesn't work through SSH again,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.960
but what you can do is you can

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.120
just type escape and that stands for the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.720
meta key. So if you ever are looking

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.015
at Emacs tutorials or references and it says

00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:06.615
meta, just know oh I have to hit

00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:08.775
escape. And in this case we do escape

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:10.935
x, then it's going to say okay give

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:13.095
me like a written command and in this

00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:16.370
case I think the written command is, what

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.130
is it for here? It's line num dash

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.930
mode and that should actually, there we go.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.330
Now we've got line numbers in here. Okay,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.265
there are various ways to jump around the

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:32.185
document. If you want to go to a

00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:33.945
particular line, let's say we wanted to go

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:36.345
to line six, we can type meta which

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:38.825
is escape and then lowercase g and then

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:40.985
another g and it says go to line

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:42.745
and we can type six and it will

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.460
jump right to that line. If we wanna

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.700
actually search for something, we just type control

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.900
s and it does a search. So if

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.540
I wanna search for hello, there it is

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.100
and it comes up immediately that that's where

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.885
we wanna go to. So, and in fact

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.485
if you wanna type, let's say we wanted

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:05.885
to find just, o, control s and then

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.485
o, it will jump to the o and

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:09.965
if you keep hitting control s again, it

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:12.680
will go to the next, instance and then

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.680
wrap around if you don't find it. So,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.440
that's the very very very basics for Emacs.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.840
It's a great editor, I don't use it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360
much so that's why I don't really know

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.225
what I'm doing in here. You can open

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.225
multiple files at once, they're called buffers in

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:31.585
Emacs and it is very powerful. In fact,

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:34.225
there's an entire programming language list built into

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:35.905
Emacs so you can make your own commands

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:40.305
and make it do very very advanced things.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.610
So anyway, right now I will do control

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.170
X, control C and it will ask me

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.370
if I wanna save it. Let's say I

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.050
save it and I type Y and it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.490
brings you back to the terminal. Thanks.
