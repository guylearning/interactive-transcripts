Hi there. In this video, we are going

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.520
to look at symbolic links, otherwise known as

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.560
symlinks, which is a way to create a

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.395
file listing in a directory that is actually

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:19.275
a file or folder from a different directory.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.115
We'll use this a lot in CS one

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:23.755
zero seven when we want to create one

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.795
directory of files that everyone has access to

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:30.130
or one particular file that everyone has access

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.010
to. Many times the actual files or folders

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.170
themselves will be read only, so you can't

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.610
go changing them. But they will be located

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.705
and accessible from your particular directory on your

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:48.505
folder. Maybe a directory where a program lives

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:52.505
and it needs access to a particular set

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.730
of files that we provide. You can have

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.170
it located in your folder as a SIM

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.850
link and therefore your program can find it

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.130
using a relative path instead of trying to

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.475
find it using an absolute path. So it's

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:09.475
a nice way to do it, and you

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:10.995
probably won't have to create too many sim

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:13.395
links, but, I wanted to show you how

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:16.675
that actually how it actually works. So, if

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.435
I look at the files here, let's do

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.075
a long listing of the files in the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.930
in my CS one hundred seven assignments folder.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.250
Let's say for instance that in assignment zero

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.570
we want to link you to some samples

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.810
directory. In fact we'll use the samples directory

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.005
fairly often in here. Here's how you could

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.245
actually do it. You would actually say ln

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:44.445
s for symbolic link and then you actually

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:48.365
type the full path, in this case it's

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:57.330
AFS IR class CS107 samples and dot meaning

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.570
put it in the current directory and then

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.010
if we do an ls dash l you'll

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.650
notice that you've got a samples directory here,

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:05.925
Okay, and it's a link, it's the l

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:09.285
fruit link and it points to where it

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:11.365
actually is. So if we actually look in

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.365
that samples, I don't think there's much in

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:17.205
there. There's only one thing called Unix Hunt

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:21.220
in there, but that's actually on the CS

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.100
one zero seven part of the file system,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940
but you've now linked to it. And so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.220
if you ever see a file like this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.257
with a little arrow notation there, it means

00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:32.577
that it's a symbolic link. And if you

00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:34.097
wanted a great one, you use the l

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:38.017
n dash s command to do it. Thanks.
