00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi there. In this video, we are going

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.040
to learn about the RM command, stands for

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.600
remove, and it will permanently remove files or

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
folders from your system. So you do have

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.935
to be a little bit careful with the

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:16.415
the r m command. There's no trash can

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.735
and there's no, way to really get back

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:21.935
unless you use the backup directory, which means

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:24.735
that you may have something from the previous

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.390
day. But if you're working on a file

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.470
that's an hour old and you remove it,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.150
well, it's gone forever. So you have to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.230
be a little bit careful. Let's see what

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.830
we can do. In this folder here, we

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.030
have some folders and some files. Let's say

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.030
that I don't want file one dot txt

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.455
anymore. So I can just type rm file

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.615
one dot txt which stands for remove file

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.455
one and then the nice thing about the

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:49.015
myth system is it asks you if you

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.535
are sure you wanna do that and I

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:52.535
can type yes and it's gone. So that

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:56.240
file is gone forever And unless I have

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.240
it in my backup somewhere or somewhere else

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.000
it's gone. So you have to be a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.440
little bit careful there. Now, I also have

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.760
some other folders in here so let's do

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.335
assign twenty three. So that's a directory and

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:13.855
if I just type r m assign twenty

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:17.455
three, it will say, I can't remember that,

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.215
it's a directory. So what you can do

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:21.615
is you can say r m dash r

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:25.560
assign twenty three and that will recursively go

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.360
into assignment twenty three and ask you for

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.280
each file if you wanna do each file,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.880
right? And that's kind of painful if you

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.485
wanted to do that, but it's and then

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:39.565
it goes into other directories and so forth

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.405
and you just have to keep hitting Y

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:42.925
to do this. There we go and I

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:45.405
hit Y too many times. Let's do this.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:51.170
Let's copy dash r assign zero to assign

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.050
23. So let's recreate the assign 23 folder

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.290
and let's do it a slightly different way

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.490
so we don't have to hit y all

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.250
these times. Now what you can do is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.095
you can say rm rf for force and

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:08.815
then I can do assign 23 and oops

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:13.615
assign 23 and it will remove all the

00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:16.380
folders or all the files and folders underneath

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.460
that and it will remove the assign 20

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.860
three directory. So notice there's no assign 23

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.580
directory. Now this dash r f notice it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.660
didn't ask me, prompt me for anything and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.780
it just did it. You have to be

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.575
very very careful. If you are on your

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:31.575
own system and you type something like r

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:35.575
m r f slash that would go and

00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:40.055
remove as many files as it could throughout

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:44.500
your entire system. Now, luckily most of the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.380
files in slash are root access only, which

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.220
means you can't actually access them, but this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.340
would be a very very bad command. So

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.700
you have to be very careful when you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.215
use dash r f because it's helpful and

00:02:57.215 --> 00:02:58.975
that it doesn't prompt you for every file,

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:00.415
but you just have to know exactly when

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:02.575
you're using it. What if I had done

00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:06.095
this? If I had done RM -RF assignments

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:10.220
and then forgot to do like and then

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.780
I did assignment assign zero and I forgot

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.220
the slash in there, it would go and

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.100
remove everything in the assignments folder and then

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.740
try to remove everything in the assign zero

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.500
folder but that's already not even there and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.420
so forth. That would be very very bad.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.955
So you have to be very careful when

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.075
you use the r m command. There's another

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.875
choice if you have a directory that's empty.

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:35.475
Let's try 23 again. So now assign twenty

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:37.875
three happens to be completely empty. You can

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.960
also just type instead of r m dash

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.880
r assign twenty three which would work and

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.000
it would ask you if you wanna do

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.600
that. You can also type r m d

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.840
I r assign 23 and it just says

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.000
oh look if it's an empty directory I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
can remove it immediately and that's how that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.556
works. So that's the RM command. Thanks.
