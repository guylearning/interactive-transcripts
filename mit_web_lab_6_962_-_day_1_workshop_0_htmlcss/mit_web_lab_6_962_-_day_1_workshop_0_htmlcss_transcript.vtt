00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Hello again, everyone. Hope pizza was good. We're

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.880
gonna go ahead and start on our first

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:15.885
workshop now. Yeah. Yeah. So our first workshop

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.925
is So as Andy mentioned, we're gonna be

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:22.365
working through building this Catbook website. And this

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.125
is gonna be our first step. And we're

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:25.965
gonna use some of the HTML CSS ideas

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:32.740
that we talked about earlier today. So for

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.820
today, we're going to be using both Versus

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.860
Code and the terminal. So if you could

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.785
go ahead and open those up, that would

00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:45.425
be great. If you haven't set up everything,

00:00:46.305 --> 00:00:50.625
you can go to weblab.ishomework0 and get that

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:53.265
set up real quick. And as always, if

00:00:53.265 --> 00:01:07.665
there's questions, then go to the queue. Alright,

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:13.185
cool. I'll move on then. Okay, so first

00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:15.425
we're going to open up our terminal. I'm

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.865
just going use the terminal on Versus Code

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:19.985
because I think it's nicer. But yeah, use

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.080
any terminal that you'd like. If you're on

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.520
Windows, make sure you're using the Git Bash

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.760
terminal. And I think Abby showed you how

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:39.125
to change that. Okay. First step, we're going

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.285
to change directory into whatever folder that we'd

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:43.125
like. I'm just going to choose desktop, but

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.045
you can also make a folder if you'd

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:47.925
like, like using m k d I r,

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.720
call it web lab or something. Yeah. Move

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:09.075
into whichever folder that you'd like. Alright. Now

00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:13.235
we're going to clone the repository. Steps for

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:16.995
this are pretty simple. You'll go to this

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:25.370
site right here. I'll open it up. That's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.810
weblab. Iscatbook. I'll leave it up for a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.490
moment so that everyone can get to it.

00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:43.885
Okay. Everyone good? Okay. Cool. Alright. Once we're

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:46.845
on the page, you can click code here.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.320
Once you're on the page, click the green

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.760
code button. And then we're just gonna copy

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.265
the command here or the link. Copy that.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:27.210
Once that's copied, has everyone gotten to that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.995
page and copied the link? Then you're going

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:34.755
to type in this command here into your

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:45.715
terminal. Git clone, and then you can copy

00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:54.770
paste the link. And then you should see

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.755
some messages resolving deltas, And that should mean

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:06.235
it's cloned. Okay. I'll wait for a second.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:17.480
Let's get up there. Okay. Alright. Next, we're

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.440
going to move into that directory. So once

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.240
again, use that command. And then in your

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.915
command line, should see you're in Catbook React.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.930
Alright. And then we're going to type in

00:04:46.930 --> 00:05:00.865
this command, git checkout w zero starter. And

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:02.545
it should say that you switch to a

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:23.605
new branch, the v zero starter. Alright. Is

00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:26.725
everyone good with that? Okay. Cool. Then we're

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:29.525
going to open up that folder. You can

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.125
do this easily on Versus Code. Go to

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:35.685
open. It'll be in desktop and then in

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:38.810
KappaC React, and you can just click open.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.050
And then if you wanna open up index.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.455
Html, drag it out here. And then if

00:05:52.455 --> 00:06:10.410
that's something that looks like this. Before we

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.210
dive in, we're going to encourage you to

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.650
do some nice formatting. Formatting is good, obviously,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.570
because it'll help you read your code better,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.225
especially when you're collaborating with other people. You

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:22.985
want to make pretty code so that other

00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:25.545
people can easily understand where your project is

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:29.065
at. Thankfully, we can use an extension that'll

00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:31.385
do most of this for us. So we'll

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:37.920
go ahead and download that. It's called Prettier,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.920
and I'll show you how to get it.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.240
Once you're at this page in Versus Code,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.335
go to this icon right here, extensions, And

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:54.095
you should see something that looks like this.

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:02.015
Once you're here, you can just type in

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:06.260
Prettier. And there should be an install button

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.060
here. I already have it, so it won't

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.140
show up. But go ahead and install it.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.555
Once that's done, then we need to change

00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:27.435
the settings so that it's in use. So

00:07:28.235 --> 00:07:31.035
you go down here, click the gear button,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.970
and then there should be a settings option.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:43.570
Click settings, and then you're going to want

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.015
to search for formatter. It should have some

00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:50.255
default option, but you want to change it

00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:52.975
to prettier, and you can do that just

00:07:52.975 --> 00:08:14.575
by searching through the drop down. All right.

00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:16.415
We also need to change it so that

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:18.495
it formats on every save. So that means

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:20.655
every time you press Control S, then it'll

00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:24.335
automatically format your code, which is really nice.

00:08:24.735 --> 00:08:27.350
So we'll type in format on save in

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.550
here, and then you just need to check

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:50.975
this little box. Alright. I'll wait for a

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:58.740
moment. Alright, is everyone good? And again, if

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.900
you're behind, then just feel free to join

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.580
the queue and we'll be ready to help.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.420
Alright, here's a little demo of what Prettier

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.555
does. Yeah, If you control s, then it

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:12.875
looks much nicer and much easier to read,

00:09:13.195 --> 00:09:22.475
understand what's going on. Let's go back and

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:28.330
look at the code. It should have something

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:39.275
similar to what's on here. If we'd like

00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:45.035
to look at the actual sites, then what

00:09:45.035 --> 00:10:43.065
you can do is But basically, to view

00:10:43.065 --> 00:10:44.985
the file, all you need to do is

00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:49.410
navigate to the folder in Finder or whatever

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.370
using Windows. You can drag it up here,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.555
and it should display whatever the website is

00:11:01.555 --> 00:11:05.315
rendering. So as you can see, we only

00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:06.755
have Hello Worlds, and then our title is

00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:09.875
Cat Book. It's pretty much what we expect,

00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:21.560
and it's up there. I'll let everyone try

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.400
that out for a moment before we jump

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:29.545
in. So again, all you need to do

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:35.065
is go to Finder, navigate to the folder

00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:37.385
for Catbook React, and then just drag in

00:11:37.385 --> 00:11:40.745
index. Html into your browser, and then it

00:11:40.745 --> 00:12:02.935
should pop up the web page. Alright. I'll

00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:08.135
move on. Okay. So looking forward, our goal

00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:09.400
at the end of this is to be

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.840
able to build this profile page in Catbook.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.120
So this is our goal for the end

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:21.800
of this workshop. Okay. Before I begin, I'll

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.560
explain a little bit about our workflow for

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.095
the workshops. So the idea is going to

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:29.455
be that I will explain something that we

00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:32.335
want to add to our website. You guys

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.415
can talk with your friends for a minute

00:12:34.415 --> 00:12:36.655
or five minutes or so. Try to implement

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:38.880
it yourself, and then we'll come back, we'll

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.200
touch base, and then we'll implement it together.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.800
If you get lost or fall behind, don't

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.040
worry because we have some things that'll help

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.255
you stay up to speed. Buckle up because

00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:55.575
we have 11 steps in this workshop. So

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:58.615
it's kind of a long one, but yeah,

00:12:58.615 --> 00:13:05.940
we'll get through it together. Okay. First, it's

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.220
just going be doing some work in the

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.820
bare bones HTML. So all I'd like you

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.140
to do is add some more text into

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.020
your document. And with that, we're going to

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.780
use some of the tags that I talked

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:25.915
about before. If you want, try to make

00:13:25.915 --> 00:13:28.555
it look like this using the tags that

00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:32.155
I've listed up here. And keep in mind

00:13:32.155 --> 00:13:35.275
that we could use things like div that

00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:37.250
I talked about before, but we like to

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.610
keep it more semantically nice. So we can

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.930
use things like section. And this one here,

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.890
we'll just add a horizontal rule. So that's

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:53.535
how get the line. So take like three

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:55.695
minutes, talk to the person next to you,

00:13:56.015 --> 00:13:57.135
and try to get as close as you

00:13:57.135 --> 00:13:59.135
can to making your website look like that.

00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:05.560
And if you want to see the changes

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.480
on your website, if you still have the

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.160
tab open in your browser, all you need

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.920
to do is reload. I haven't made any

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:29.505
changes, so you won't see anything. Hello and

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:31.585
if you're too shy to add yourself to

00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:33.265
the queue which you should not be because

00:14:33.265 --> 00:14:35.940
the queue is very approachable But if you

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.620
don't wanna add yourself to the queue, we

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.100
have Lucas and Daniel walking around so you

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.700
can just flag them down if you need

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:56.585
help with anything real quick. Okay. I'll give

00:14:56.585 --> 00:15:00.265
you guys like three more minutes to try

00:15:00.265 --> 00:16:12.640
to get it done. Also if you wanted

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.800
an alternative to opening up the thing without

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.440
having to go through Finder or anything, another

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.385
thing you can do is right click on

00:16:21.385 --> 00:16:24.985
the file and just copy the path here.

00:16:26.825 --> 00:16:29.465
Copy the path, and then if you go

00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:32.825
into browser, think you can just paste it,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:59.595
and then it'll open up. Same thing. Alright.

00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:01.115
We're gonna start working through it together now.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.580
So going through what we see up here,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.420
obviously we see this big header up here,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.380
buka buka. And for that, I think we're

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:25.435
gonna use the header tags h one. Oh,

00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:30.075
wait. Did you get the printouts? It's in

00:17:30.075 --> 00:17:43.910
my bag. Is that good? One more. One

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:55.725
more. Alright. Under that, we have our line

00:17:55.725 --> 00:17:57.645
here. And I mentioned that you can use

00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:00.900
the HR tag. And it's actually a self

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.060
closing tag. Maybe I should have mentioned that.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.500
But of course, you could just use the

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.980
MDN web docs to find that out. And

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.180
it makes sense because you're not going to

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:13.665
really enclose anything within a line. Next, you

00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:15.425
didn't have to do this, but I'd like

00:18:15.425 --> 00:18:19.425
for you to do a section tag so

00:18:19.425 --> 00:18:20.945
that we can group up our about me

00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:24.545
and our favorite type of cat. And within

00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:31.290
the first section, we'll do a header for

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.490
about me. And you'll notice that I used

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.570
h four here. Something about the header tags

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.465
is that they have like different default sizings

00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:44.345
under them already, and the higher the number,

00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:47.065
the smaller the text. So if you want

00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:50.905
various subheadings, you can use h three, h

00:18:50.905 --> 00:18:53.865
five, h whatever. But I'll use h four

00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:57.380
for this. And then over here, we're gonna

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:05.220
use p. And then I won't talk about

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.420
the full text, but you can do it

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:12.195
if you want. Then we'll have the other

00:19:12.195 --> 00:19:48.295
section. I turned it off. This is about

00:19:48.295 --> 00:19:51.095
what it should look like. If we go

00:19:51.095 --> 00:19:54.610
to add up here and reload, then we

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.530
should see that it looks closer to what

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.850
we want. And feel free to just add

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.610
whatever text you want. I don't really care.

00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:12.445
Alright, I'll wait for a moment for everyone

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:15.245
to get up to speed and make sure

00:20:15.245 --> 00:20:18.125
that you can see this in your browser.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.315
Okay. Cool. Alright, we're going to move on.

00:20:39.035 --> 00:20:40.795
And before we do that, I'd like you

00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:43.355
to type in these commands into your terminal.

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:50.395
First, we're going to type in git reset

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:54.750
hard. And I'll explain what this does exactly

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.910
in a second. And then we're going to

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.510
type in git checkouts. That'll be zero step

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:10.305
one. Wait for a moment for everyone to

00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:20.450
do that. Okay. So yeah, what exactly are

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.970
these commands doing? Okay. The first one that

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.410
I told you to do was git reset

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.530
hard. So git reset hard is going to

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.675
reset your local version of the code to

00:21:33.675 --> 00:21:36.875
be whatever was last committed. So for example,

00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:40.155
let's say you were working on some code,

00:21:40.875 --> 00:21:42.235
it kind of got away from you and

00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:44.155
you don't know what's going on anymore, and

00:21:44.155 --> 00:21:45.435
you just want to go back to the

00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:50.260
last landmark point that you were at. Then

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.260
you can just type in git recess hard,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.300
and it'll reset your code to wherever you

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.300
last committed. You can kind of think of

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.275
GitHub as the place where all the nice

00:22:02.275 --> 00:22:04.915
code is. You give it to you, and

00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:09.635
then you do your work on it. And

00:22:09.635 --> 00:22:13.235
maybe you mess up, and you wish that

00:22:13.235 --> 00:22:15.970
you could undo all of your work, but

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.410
not undo everything. Right? Then you can just

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.210
do git reset dash dash hard, and your

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.170
code will be good as new. The checkout

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.170
step, we kind of mentioned before in our

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.485
git basics lecture, but all it's doing is

00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:35.605
changing or it's switching your version of the

00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.005
code to a different branch of the repository.

00:22:40.245 --> 00:22:45.120
Yeah. There's a slight difference between the one

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.360
we showed you the first time with dash

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.720
b. So that's going to make a new

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.120
branch. This one is just switching to a

00:22:51.120 --> 00:23:00.435
branch that we already have created. So in

00:23:00.435 --> 00:23:02.995
summary, if you ever get lost, then don't

00:23:02.995 --> 00:23:04.515
worry because you can just type in git

00:23:04.515 --> 00:23:06.995
reset hard and then check out whatever step

00:23:06.995 --> 00:23:10.275
we're on, and you'll be good as new,

00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:12.035
and you can just follow along from there.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.560
A quick note is that you shouldn't abuse

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.000
git recess dash dash hard for every project

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.760
that you do. It works really well for

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.240
our workshops because we're just trying to through

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.835
something together. But if you're doing your projects

00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:31.355
and you make a lot of changes and

00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:33.035
you just get recess dash dash hard, then

00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:35.595
it'll be lost forever. So keep that in

00:23:35.595 --> 00:23:42.555
mind. Okay. So back to where we were.

00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:49.170
We'll type in those two commands. And you'll

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.970
notice that it actually has the correct solution

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.170
code to have exactly what is up on

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:06.685
the slide. Again, if I try to do

00:24:06.685 --> 00:24:11.965
this, then my code matches what it should

00:24:11.965 --> 00:24:22.710
be. Okay. Cool. Move on to our first

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.670
step, and that's gonna be to add an

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:31.125
image. And I'll have the commands for to

00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:32.565
get to whatever step we're on in the

00:24:32.565 --> 00:24:36.165
corner or on this page here. And I'll

00:24:36.165 --> 00:24:38.165
have the progress bar to help you see

00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:45.230
where we are. So, yeah, let's try to

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.510
add an image to our website. We're gonna

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.430
put it above the buka buka, and it's

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.590
gonna be an image that's already in our

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.150
folder. It'll be cat dot p n g.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:00.565
It's just like a cat. And I'll give

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:03.205
you guys two minutes to use the image

00:25:03.205 --> 00:25:04.805
tag that we talked about in the earlier

00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:08.005
lecture and try to get your website to

00:25:08.005 --> 00:25:26.435
look like that. Once you've got the image

00:25:26.435 --> 00:25:29.235
showing up, also remember to add some alt

00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:53.885
text. You can make whatever you want. And

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.805
remember, if you forget the syntax for anything,

00:25:55.805 --> 00:26:07.880
it's just a Google search away. Alright. I'll

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.640
go ahead and work through it with you

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.560
guys. So if you recall, image is a

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.920
self closing tag, and we use this attribute

00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:21.735
to get the right picture. And I'm just

00:26:21.735 --> 00:26:24.455
using this name because the name of our

00:26:24.455 --> 00:26:27.495
image is cat p n g. And it's

00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:29.495
in the same directory as our HTML document,

00:26:29.495 --> 00:26:31.495
so I don't need to do anything fancy.

00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:33.550
And then for alt text, I can just

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:44.830
say cat or whatever. And remember, it's self

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.510
closing, so we don't need to have opening

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.585
and closing tags. We just add this forward

00:26:48.585 --> 00:26:52.025
slash at the end. It will render correctly.

00:26:54.745 --> 00:27:05.720
Let's reload, and there's our image. I'll give

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.880
everyone a moment to get caught up again.

00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:21.985
Alright. Sounds like people are done, so I'll

00:27:21.985 --> 00:27:25.265
move on. Alright. Next, we're going to do

00:27:25.265 --> 00:27:30.120
some centering. Before we do that, remember to

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.560
type in the commands that you see over

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.800
there. So we're going to get reset hard

00:27:33.800 --> 00:28:08.630
and check out the next step. Okay. For

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.550
this step, I'd like to do some centering.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.150
So I want to move So if you

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.585
see how all of our text is, like,

00:28:13.585 --> 00:28:16.065
on the left side, I'd like to change,

00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:17.585
like, at least one thing so that it

00:28:17.585 --> 00:28:20.065
can be in the center because that's what

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:23.745
our end goal kind of looks like. So

00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:29.530
here's what I'll do. For this, we're gonna

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:38.890
open up our CSS document. And we're gonna

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:46.195
define a class. Or actually first, how about

00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:51.715
we just link our stylesheet? The way we're

00:28:51.715 --> 00:28:54.675
going to do that is in the header

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.840
or in the head element. Just add an

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:05.400
element linking. This rel thing just tells it

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.015
to interpret it as a style sheet, and

00:29:08.015 --> 00:29:11.695
then href tells it what to look at.

00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:18.815
Again, this link element is also self closing.

00:29:35.255 --> 00:29:37.895
Alright. I'll let everyone get that linked up.

00:29:40.855 --> 00:29:43.415
Okay. Next, we're going to try to actually

00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:47.575
apply some styling onto our elements. So as

00:29:47.575 --> 00:29:49.335
I said before, I want to have things

00:29:49.335 --> 00:29:58.540
centered. I'll walk you through this one because

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.340
I haven't shown you that much about this

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.685
stuff yet. But what we're going to do

00:30:04.685 --> 00:30:06.765
is define a class first in our CSS

00:30:06.765 --> 00:30:13.325
document. And actually, have it split screened. You

00:30:13.325 --> 00:30:19.890
guys can see both things. But in our

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:24.130
CSS document, we're going to define a class

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:31.455
or we're going to select a class called

00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:37.775
view text center, and it's going to have

00:30:37.775 --> 00:30:51.030
this attributes. Let everyone get that copy down.

00:30:57.845 --> 00:31:00.085
As a quick aside, whenever we have a

00:31:00.085 --> 00:31:03.205
class that's only really applying one thing, we

00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:06.405
call it a utility class, and that's denoted

00:31:06.405 --> 00:31:11.760
by the u prefix on the thing. And

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.560
the dot is here because it's a class.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.880
So if there were an ID or something,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.480
then we'd use a hashtag sign. But because

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.440
it's a class, we're just going to use

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:31.215
dot. And now once we have our class

00:31:31.215 --> 00:31:32.895
in here, we can apply it to whatever

00:31:32.895 --> 00:31:36.495
we want. So how about we apply it

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:39.535
to the header, the big header, h one?

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.520
And the way we're gonna do that is

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.200
by setting the class attributes to the uTextCenter.

00:31:53.355 --> 00:32:08.910
Then you should see that the text is

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:25.355
now centered. I'll give everyone a moment to

00:32:25.355 --> 00:32:38.070
do that, and I'll move on. Again, all

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.950
I did was create this class here in

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:43.270
the style sheet, in the CSS, or styles

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.310
dot CSS, and then we apply it to

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.950
an element by changing the attribute of class

00:32:50.275 --> 00:32:55.395
to new text center. Okay, cool. I'll move

00:32:55.395 --> 00:33:03.475
on. Alright. Go ahead and reset dash dash

00:33:03.475 --> 00:33:22.615
hard and check out step three. Alright. We're

00:33:22.615 --> 00:33:24.215
going do some more styling in this one.

00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:26.935
And we're just going to use the class

00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:29.415
that we created earlier to center other parts

00:33:29.415 --> 00:33:34.500
of our document. Shows the power of how

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.140
classes can be used for many different elements,

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.180
unlike IDs. Our goal is to make our

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.420
website look like this, and I'll give you

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.460
guys a minute or so to do that.

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:12.490
Alright. Since this one's not too bad, I'll

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:15.370
just go ahead and live code it with

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:18.145
you guys. So again, we already defined our

00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:19.265
class, so all we need to do is

00:34:19.265 --> 00:34:27.025
apply it to these other things. And you'll

00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:29.360
notice that I put this in the section

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.320
element, and that means it'll apply to everything

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.520
within it as well. So everything is going

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.320
to be centered in the about me. And

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.920
then if I also want to center this,

00:34:39.920 --> 00:35:06.610
I'll do the same thing. Okay, cool. And

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.875
as a review, what I just said, if

00:35:09.875 --> 00:35:11.875
you apply the class to these section elements,

00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:15.155
then it'll apply to everything within it. Maybe

00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:16.755
that gives you an idea of why div

00:35:16.755 --> 00:35:18.915
or span would be useful. You're just trying

00:35:18.915 --> 00:35:20.995
to select an entire section. It doesn't make

00:35:20.995 --> 00:35:22.915
sense to do that for every single element,

00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:24.200
and it makes more sense to do that

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:30.520
for a container on all of it. Step

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.800
four is going be something pretty common, that's

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.505
importing fonts. So first, we're going to reset

00:35:37.505 --> 00:35:41.025
dash dash hard and check out the next

00:35:41.025 --> 00:35:58.600
step. All right. Let's go find a font

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.360
that's better than the one that we have

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.045
on default. Your go to website, in this

00:36:05.045 --> 00:36:08.965
case, is going to be fonts.google.com. Pretty easy

00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:21.640
to remember. You can just go to the

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.240
search bar and search for any font that

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.600
you like. I'm going use Open Sans today,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.920
but feel free to choose a more interesting

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.915
one. Once you're on fonts.google.com, you can just

00:36:33.915 --> 00:36:36.715
look it up, and they have it right

00:36:36.715 --> 00:36:48.920
here. Once you're there, click on the font

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.280
that you'd like. And then we're going to

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.280
head to this get font button. It should

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:03.405
be in the top right corner. And then

00:37:03.405 --> 00:37:04.525
you'll get to a page that looks like

00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:13.085
this. Next, we're going to click get embed

00:37:13.085 --> 00:37:20.450
code. There are some fancy options here that

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:24.050
you can play around with later, but I'm

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.290
just gonna choose an easy option. I'll just

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:31.915
use the defaults. Yeah. Next, once you're on

00:37:31.915 --> 00:37:35.275
this page here, and I have the directions

00:37:35.275 --> 00:37:38.955
up on here. Let everyone get to there.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.190
Once you're here, the default option is link,

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.030
but I'm actually going to use import because

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.630
it'll be nicer to just put in our

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:52.870
CSS document. And they actually have it so

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.625
that it'll go in an HTML here. But

00:37:57.465 --> 00:38:00.105
for our purposes, I'm just gonna copy this

00:38:00.105 --> 00:38:06.745
intersection that's within the element tags. So copy

00:38:06.745 --> 00:38:14.080
that. Then we're going to move back to

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:20.480
our CSS stylesheet, and we'll import it up

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:34.445
here. So again, we're gonna go to here,

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:37.950
click on import instead of link. Go to

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.110
the first one, embed code in the head,

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.350
and instead of including these tags, which would

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.190
work for putting it in the head of

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.150
our HTML, we'll just copy paste this inner

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.350
part here so we can put it in

00:38:50.350 --> 00:39:00.215
the stylesheet directly. Okay. Cool. Once that's done,

00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:08.320
we can apply it to our elements. In

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.080
this case, I'd like it to be applied

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.040
to everything, basically, on the document. So instead

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.760
of defining or selecting a class or an

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.960
element and applying it to only those, I'll

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:30.385
just select the entire body. So to do

00:39:30.385 --> 00:39:32.545
that, you can just put body in the

00:39:32.545 --> 00:39:35.425
selector, and then within it, we're gonna change

00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:44.000
this attribute font family. Because we imported, it'll

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.040
let us directly refer to Open Sans or

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:56.585
whatever font that you imported. And then if

00:39:56.585 --> 00:40:02.265
we go back to our website, the font

00:40:02.265 --> 00:40:13.120
should be updated to whatever you chose. Because

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.120
we like having fallbacks and safety for safety

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.160
reasons, if we go back to our code,

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.305
we can also add a fallback option in

00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:29.065
case our stylesheet didn't actually import the right

00:40:29.065 --> 00:40:30.745
font, and it doesn't know what Open Sans

00:40:30.745 --> 00:40:34.425
is. So we can put Sans Serif. That's

00:40:34.425 --> 00:40:38.790
a built in. In the case that we

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.350
don't have Open Sans, then our web page

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.470
will just default to Sans Serif. And you

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.830
can do that by just adding it after

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:57.935
some commas. Okay. Cool. I'll move on to

00:40:57.935 --> 00:41:08.760
the nav bar. And as always, we're gonna

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:14.600
reset dash dash hard. Check out we're at

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:29.055
step five. So if you remember in our

00:41:29.055 --> 00:41:31.455
end goal, we had a nice bar at

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.015
the top that said cat book. And we're

00:41:34.015 --> 00:41:35.750
going to do that using the nav bar

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.750
element. So what I want you to do

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.870
is add this nav element to the top

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:50.155
of your body. Give everyone a moment to

00:41:50.155 --> 00:42:00.955
do that. I guess I'll do it with

00:42:00.955 --> 00:42:13.350
you guys. Also add this header elements for

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:20.155
cat book. Once you've done that, we're going

00:42:20.155 --> 00:42:22.075
to preemptively add these classes because we know

00:42:22.075 --> 00:42:26.955
we want to style it later. So I'm

00:42:26.955 --> 00:42:28.475
going to assume that we're going to use

00:42:28.475 --> 00:42:30.795
this class called nav container, which we'll define

00:42:30.795 --> 00:42:35.590
later in here. And I guess for the

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:48.045
header, we can also define something. And again,

00:42:48.045 --> 00:42:50.205
haven't done any styling to it yet, but

00:42:50.205 --> 00:42:52.685
I'm just doing this preemptively because we will

00:42:52.685 --> 00:42:54.125
do it in the future in our style

00:42:54.125 --> 00:43:04.440
CSS document. Okay. Yeah. So let's go and

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.960
do that. Before we do that, I'll touch

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.595
a little bit on CSS variables. CSS does

00:43:13.595 --> 00:43:16.795
support a type of variable, and this is

00:43:16.795 --> 00:43:18.475
helpful if you're going to be using the

00:43:18.475 --> 00:43:21.115
same thing over and over again. For example,

00:43:21.275 --> 00:43:23.275
a color that's in hex, you don't want

00:43:23.275 --> 00:43:24.715
to keep typing out the hex, and maybe

00:43:24.715 --> 00:43:26.235
it's nice to just know what color it

00:43:26.235 --> 00:43:30.720
is already. The syntax for that is going

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:39.680
to be as follows. So the reason that

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.440
it uses root, and it'll use colon when

00:43:42.795 --> 00:43:45.115
referring to root is so that it'll apply

00:43:45.115 --> 00:43:47.275
to the entire web page. If you remember

00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:49.435
at the beginning of the first lecture, I

00:43:49.435 --> 00:43:50.875
told you guys that the HTML tag that

00:43:50.875 --> 00:43:53.835
contains everything is referred to as the root.

00:43:53.835 --> 00:43:55.355
So this will just make sure that you

00:43:55.355 --> 00:44:00.130
can use this variable anywhere at all. And

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.810
then for variables, we're going to use these

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:08.130
two dashes, and then the variable name, and

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:12.365
then what it's set to. So if I

00:44:12.365 --> 00:44:15.805
use exactly what's on there, can I use

00:44:16.205 --> 00:44:39.730
this color? Another nice feature is that you

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:41.570
can click on this and then select another

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:50.425
color. Okay. Once we've defined those variables, we

00:44:50.425 --> 00:44:53.465
can go ahead and use them in other

00:44:53.465 --> 00:44:58.380
styling. So let's go ahead and style that

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.260
class that we used over here in the

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:07.100
nav element. Or let's use the nav title

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:13.915
one, I guess. Here. And then if we

00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:15.595
actually want to extract the value from a

00:45:15.595 --> 00:45:17.435
variable, we'll have to wrap it in this

00:45:17.435 --> 00:45:29.280
var function thing. And then another attribute will

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:48.215
change. Spot size. We're also going to undo

00:45:48.215 --> 00:45:51.495
some of the default formatting that's been applied

00:45:51.495 --> 00:45:55.960
to h1. So CSS already or HTML already

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.600
interprets some default formats. You can see the

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.240
font family is also chosen for you. But

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.280
if we want to undo that, then we

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.760
have to explicitly tell it in the style

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.165
sheet. So we're also going to add the

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:26.120
following attributes, like margin and font weight. Okay.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:37.655
And then, yeah, we should see our nav

00:46:37.655 --> 00:46:41.975
bar up at the top here. And just

00:46:41.975 --> 00:46:44.455
to make sure that your variables are working,

00:46:45.015 --> 00:46:47.895
you can go into here, change the color,

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:55.150
and reload. And yeah, it looks like it

00:46:55.150 --> 00:47:06.735
changed. Give everyone a moment to get caught

00:47:06.735 --> 00:47:18.520
up. Okay. Cool. Alright. Evan will take you

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:35.325
guys on to the next steps. Okay. So

00:47:35.325 --> 00:47:39.165
now we have a nav bar. So let's

00:47:39.165 --> 00:47:40.765
go ahead and try to style the nav

00:47:40.765 --> 00:47:44.020
bar to have a different look. So first,

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:53.140
let's check out step six. Alright. So right

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.965
now the nav bar is white and white

00:47:56.965 --> 00:47:58.805
with blue text, but we want to have

00:47:58.805 --> 00:48:04.725
it now blue with white text. So using

00:48:04.725 --> 00:48:08.645
the CSS variables that we defined earlier, try

00:48:08.645 --> 00:48:14.120
to style the nav bar. And I'll give

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.200
you guys a couple of minutes to do

00:48:16.200 --> 00:49:27.355
that. So for sake of time, I'm gonna

00:49:27.355 --> 00:49:29.515
start going over how you did it for

00:49:29.515 --> 00:49:36.540
this one. So since we have the we

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.980
add the NavContainer class that Sanve added earlier,

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.180
and then just to style it, you can

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.475
create the NavContainer class within the CSS file.

00:49:49.875 --> 00:49:53.315
And we want the background color to be

00:49:53.475 --> 00:49:56.115
the blue. So the blue is our primary

00:49:56.115 --> 00:50:05.890
variable here. So primary variable. And then we

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.690
now want the text color to be white.

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.490
And that's our let's just call it white.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.675
We rename that to white. And if we

00:50:14.675 --> 00:50:17.715
reload, we now have a blue background with

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:25.955
white text. Alright. So because sitting and coding

00:50:25.955 --> 00:50:27.635
HTML for a long time is kind of

00:50:27.635 --> 00:50:30.340
difficult, we're going to give you guys a

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.420
five minute break. So if you need to

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.900
use the restroom, grab some water, feel free.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.900
But for the rest of us, I wanna

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.500
get us up and moving a little bit.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.780
So raise your hand if you think you

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.425
can wall sit longer than me. Okay. We

00:50:42.425 --> 00:50:46.905
got one, two oh, thank you, Lucas. Anyone?

00:50:46.905 --> 00:50:50.425
Anyone? Alright. Well, y'all are gonna find out

00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:52.985
because we're all gonna wall sit. Everyone find

00:50:52.985 --> 00:51:05.910
a spot on the wall. Come on. Even

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:07.270
if you don't think you can out wall

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.590
sit me, you can still come and do

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:11.030
a wall sit for as long as you

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:26.900
can. Let's go guys. Come on. Come on.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.340
Pick it up. Pick it up. I know.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:41.565
We don't have much time here. Alright. I'm

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:44.205
gonna start the wall sit battle in like

00:51:44.205 --> 00:51:48.925
twenty seconds. Hey, Evan. Could you turn on

00:51:48.925 --> 00:51:53.390
some music or something? A secret weapon? That

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:58.430
doesn't sound good for me. Is that why

00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.630
you chose a spot right next to me

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:03.470
so you can pull some weirdness? Heck yeah.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:09.255
That's what I like to see. Alright. Ready?

00:52:09.255 --> 00:52:12.935
We're gonna start in three, two, one, go.

00:52:16.535 --> 00:52:18.455
I'm setting a max cap of four minutes

00:52:18.455 --> 00:52:20.215
so that we'll have time for the actual

00:52:20.215 --> 00:52:24.290
HTML and CSS programming of our lecture. So

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:25.810
if you can make it to four minutes,

00:52:25.810 --> 00:53:34.045
you've effectively won. Wait. There there's no the

00:53:34.045 --> 00:53:37.005
the only sound options are these, but these

00:53:37.005 --> 00:53:58.415
two don't work. I don't think it I

00:53:58.415 --> 00:54:03.535
don't think it worked. Why are so many

00:54:03.535 --> 00:54:05.295
of you guys still up? This is scary.

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.890
Or down, I mean. Okay, fine, fine, fine.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.690
Lucas is yelling at me to get 90

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:23.655
come on. Okay, I'm 90 degrees now. Hey,

00:54:23.655 --> 00:54:26.055
Lucas. You're not 90 degrees either. What is

00:54:26.055 --> 00:55:05.880
this? Ow. I'm regretting my life choices right

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:15.435
now, I'm not gonna lie. Alright, we hit

00:55:15.435 --> 00:55:22.075
three minutes. Oh my god. Lucas, what? Guys,

00:55:22.075 --> 00:55:23.755
I'm all set for longer than Lucas. Let's

00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:51.275
go. Thirty seconds left. That's that's the strat.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:11.865
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,

00:56:12.185 --> 00:56:22.630
two, one. Everyone down. At those people who

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.710
went the full four minutes, y'all are amazing.

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:25.750
I wish I had a prize for you,

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.670
but I don't. Alright, back to Evan and

00:56:27.670 --> 00:57:19.180
Sanvent. Evan, back to your seats. Alright. Okay,

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.780
we'll move on to step seven which is

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:26.380
removing the margin. So as always reset hard

00:57:29.365 --> 00:57:36.245
and check out step seven. So if we

00:57:36.245 --> 00:57:42.645
look at our webpage here, we have this

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.400
slight white space around everything and we can

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.080
see it here too. We have white space

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.200
around everything in the document which is not

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.400
ideal. We want something to, something that's flush

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.975
with the edges of the browser. So we

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:01.055
need to figure out how to fill this

00:58:01.135 --> 00:58:04.255
space up and to do this, the easiest

00:58:04.255 --> 00:58:06.335
way to figure out what's going wrong with

00:58:06.335 --> 00:58:08.815
your website on the front end is to

00:58:08.815 --> 00:58:12.255
use developer tools. So with developer tools, you

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.815
can just right click and hit inspect element

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.360
and you have this sort of mouse tool

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.360
which lets you hover over elements and it

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:23.040
tells you which element you're over. If we

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.760
hover over the nav bar here, can the

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.195
nav title class and we can see a

00:58:28.195 --> 00:58:31.475
couple other attributes on it such as the

00:58:31.475 --> 00:58:35.955
size, the color and things like that. So

00:58:35.955 --> 00:58:38.515
as for the white space around the whole

00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:41.270
website, if we click on body here, then

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:44.390
we see that there's this little box down

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:45.990
here and this is what's called the box

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:49.510
model. And this lets you see what the

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:52.710
sort of sizing of your HTML boxes are.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:56.015
So we have what's called a margin, the

00:58:56.015 --> 00:58:58.975
border, padding, and then the content. So margin

00:58:58.975 --> 00:59:02.975
is the space around your content. It's just

00:59:03.375 --> 00:59:05.455
used in the typical form of the word.

00:59:05.455 --> 00:59:07.560
Padding is spacing that goes into the margin

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.400
and we'll see that in a sec. And

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.040
content is the actual size of the content.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.000
So we want to get rid of this

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.280
margin around the outside which makes it so

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:29.415
that there's white space. So one thing about

00:59:29.415 --> 00:59:31.255
the margin CSS attribute that we'll talk about

00:59:31.255 --> 00:59:34.855
briefly is that it actually has something called

00:59:34.855 --> 00:59:38.190
ordering. So you can specify one number or

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:40.350
you can specify multiple numbers. And depending on

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:46.350
what you specify, it changes the look of

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:51.345
the margin. So right now if you want

00:59:51.345 --> 00:59:53.105
to get rid of the margin around the

00:59:53.105 --> 00:59:57.825
outside on the body, then we can put

00:59:57.825 --> 01:00:01.105
in a margin zero. And if we reload,

01:00:01.105 --> 01:00:02.785
we see that it applies a zero margin

01:00:02.785 --> 01:00:05.745
to everything around the box. So if you

01:00:05.745 --> 01:00:08.100
look at the box of the body, everything

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.020
around it is a dash indicating that there's

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.260
no margin at all. But if we put

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.420
in two numbers, what it does is it

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.140
fills it it fills it starting from the

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.980
top and going clockwise and repeats if necessary.

01:00:20.835 --> 01:00:24.115
Necessary. So if, for example, we wanted it

01:00:24.115 --> 01:00:26.355
to be flush with the wall on the

01:00:26.675 --> 01:00:28.675
top but not on the sides, then we

01:00:28.675 --> 01:00:31.235
could put in like a zero then zero

01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:34.820
pixels and then 10 pixels, And this would

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.260
fill it in starting from the top and

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:41.380
going around. And this places a 10 pixel

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:46.045
margin on the side. So it has these

01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:47.965
10 pixel margins on the sides, but zero

01:00:47.965 --> 01:00:51.405
on the top and bottom. And again, if

01:00:51.405 --> 01:00:55.565
you do a third one, then it fills

01:00:55.565 --> 01:00:56.685
it in starting with the top and going

01:00:56.685 --> 01:00:58.890
clockwise. So actually you wouldn't be able to

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:00.090
tell with this one because it'll just be

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.690
white. But then if we reload and open

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:10.170
up Developer Tools again, if we open up

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.385
Developer Tools, it's bit hard to see but

01:01:12.385 --> 01:01:14.305
you can see the 10, and 20. And

01:01:14.305 --> 01:01:16.945
you can play around with this for yourself.

01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:20.385
Just adjust the numbers on any of your

01:01:20.465 --> 01:01:23.265
distance attributes, so that's things like margin or

01:01:23.265 --> 01:01:25.265
pixel, and it'll fill in from the top

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:28.350
going around clockwise. So we can set that

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:30.110
back to zero because that's what we want.

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:36.830
And yeah. So now another piece of styling

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:38.590
that we want to do is add padding.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.430
So if we look at our, if you

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.115
look at the top here, this not only

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:44.275
is the nav bar flushed with the browser

01:01:44.275 --> 01:01:47.475
walls but so is the text and that

01:01:47.475 --> 01:01:48.995
looks kind of bad as well. So you

01:01:48.995 --> 01:01:51.555
want to add padding and we can do

01:01:51.555 --> 01:01:54.195
that in a similar manner to our margin

01:01:54.195 --> 01:01:55.970
and since we want eight on the top

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:59.330
and 16 on the side, if we go

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:02.770
into the nav container which is the container

01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:05.010
where we want to have padding. So padding

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:08.545
sort of is added to make the elements

01:02:08.545 --> 01:02:11.825
within a container, so its children spaced off

01:02:11.825 --> 01:02:15.665
from the edges. So if we add padding

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:20.400
to our nav container and we'll want eight

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.880
pixels and 16 pixels. It'll do something like

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.520
this and get the padding that we want.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.440
But why do we choose eight pixels and

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.805
16 pixels? Well this is something that's called

01:02:35.805 --> 01:02:38.765
the eight point grid system and so this

01:02:38.765 --> 01:02:42.045
is choosing all your distances to be multiples

01:02:42.045 --> 01:02:45.405
of eight or a half multiple of eight.

01:02:45.725 --> 01:02:49.340
And this is just a standard to make

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.340
things visually appealing and just have a very

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.500
consistent format. So we just hard coded in

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.020
the padding here but to enforce this eight

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.780
point grid system, one thing we can do

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.855
is use the CSS variables again. So instead

01:03:04.855 --> 01:03:06.855
of only having colors, we can also add

01:03:06.855 --> 01:03:10.375
in distances. So x small is four pixels

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:13.015
and after that we have the multiples of

01:03:13.015 --> 01:03:19.650
eight. And these sorts of distance metrics are

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.010
built into CSS libraries and things like that,

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.250
which we'll talk about more next week in

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:30.035
the advanced CSS lecture. Now that if we

01:03:30.035 --> 01:03:33.315
define these variables, then when we set up,

01:03:33.315 --> 01:03:34.835
when we want to set up padding like

01:03:34.835 --> 01:03:37.315
eight pixels and 16 pixels, we can directly

01:03:37.315 --> 01:03:40.115
call on the variables. So eight pixels corresponds

01:03:40.115 --> 01:03:43.395
to small and then 16 pixels corresponds to

01:03:43.395 --> 01:03:47.650
medium. So if we place this in, we

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:49.810
should see that there's no change. But now

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.730
we have a system where we can directly

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:55.490
enforce the eight point grid system just by

01:03:55.490 --> 01:04:01.755
using the CSS variables that we defined. One

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:04.395
more distance metric that I'll talk about for

01:04:04.395 --> 01:04:05.915
a second is just width and height and

01:04:05.915 --> 01:04:09.435
that's pretty self explanatory. It sets the most

01:04:09.435 --> 01:04:12.235
innermost box but we don't actually need to

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.800
set it here because if we don't set

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.040
it, it implicitly just fills the entire space.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.920
And here's a quick exercise which is rounding

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.440
corners. If we have, on our image here,

01:04:28.545 --> 01:04:30.305
on our image here we have very sharp

01:04:30.305 --> 01:04:33.105
corners but if we wanted to style it

01:04:33.105 --> 01:04:36.065
a bit and add rounded corners, we can

01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:39.345
use the border radius attribute. So go ahead

01:04:39.345 --> 01:04:41.265
and take a minute or so just to

01:04:41.265 --> 01:04:45.110
try to round off the corners of your

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:53.270
image. Oh and also I forgot to reset

01:04:53.270 --> 01:06:37.015
to step eight. So this one is not

01:06:37.015 --> 01:06:39.495
too complicated. We the main thing we just

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.175
need to do is we need to add

01:06:41.175 --> 01:06:45.050
a class to our image which is what

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:46.890
actually contains our avatar and we can just

01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:49.770
call the class avatar. And then we can

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:51.930
create an avatar class and we want to

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:54.250
adjust the border radius attribute and we can

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.610
set it to maybe like our medium variable.

01:06:59.305 --> 01:07:03.065
And that we see we get rounding corners.

01:07:05.145 --> 01:07:15.385
So one quick exercise you could do after

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.500
after class sometime later today is creating a

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.260
perfect circle. So this would be to, this

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.940
would be using the border radius attribute and

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.260
maybe some other attributes we've learned about today

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.940
to try to make the avatar a circle.

01:07:25.325 --> 01:07:27.325
But for the sake of time today, we'll

01:07:27.325 --> 01:07:30.765
skip this and yeah. You can just check

01:07:30.765 --> 01:07:32.845
out to step 10 if you want to

01:07:32.845 --> 01:07:48.170
see the result. Step 10, you have a

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:51.625
circle. Now we're going shift gears a little

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:53.305
bit, we've been styling a lot of stuff

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:55.785
but now we're going talk about actually arranging

01:07:55.785 --> 01:08:00.825
things on our page. So our final result,

01:08:00.825 --> 01:08:02.270
we want something to look like this. We

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.190
want our about me text and our favorite

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:05.950
type of cat text to be next to

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.390
each other but currently we just have them

01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:10.030
vertically stacked which is the sort of arrangement

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:15.485
that HTML defaults to. So there's a couple

01:08:15.485 --> 01:08:17.965
of different ways to arrange things on a

01:08:17.965 --> 01:08:20.365
page in CSS. One is called float and

01:08:20.365 --> 01:08:22.925
one is called flex. But float is outdated

01:08:22.925 --> 01:08:27.250
and we use flex now. And you'll be

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:30.850
using Flex a lot throughout your project at

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:33.890
the end and we'll see it a couple

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:38.610
more times this week too. To do Flex

01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:41.615
you just set up some display flex and

01:08:41.615 --> 01:08:45.855
then after that there's a number of other

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.615
things that you can adjust. So flex is

01:08:47.615 --> 01:08:52.415
actually pretty extensive so there's this CSS Tricks

01:08:52.415 --> 01:08:56.335
website. You can visit webweb.isflex to get to

01:08:56.335 --> 01:08:58.300
it and it sort of discusses all the

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.940
different settings you have for flex. So to

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.540
get flex started the main thing you put

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.540
in your CSS is display flex but then

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:08.540
after that you have all these attributes that

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.220
you can adjust. So for example one of

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.825
them is flex direction and this is sort

01:09:12.825 --> 01:09:14.025
of one that we want to go for

01:09:14.025 --> 01:09:17.225
because this adjusts whether the elements within a

01:09:17.225 --> 01:09:20.905
parent container are arranged horizontally or vertically. There's

01:09:20.905 --> 01:09:25.065
wrapping, there's justify content and align items. So

01:09:25.065 --> 01:09:29.040
these two sort of, so justify content is

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.040
how things are arranged on the main axis,

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.680
align items is how they're arranged on the

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.480
orthogonal axis, and these are also very important

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.480
for styling. And you can read through the

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.525
rest of the ones in here on your

01:09:42.525 --> 01:09:48.525
own. If you look at this GIF here,

01:09:48.525 --> 01:09:52.045
can see adjusting the flex direction will change

01:09:52.045 --> 01:09:58.660
it from being arranged horizontally to vertically. So

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.460
now we want our currently vertically stacked About

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.300
Me and Favorite Type of Cat boxes to

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.260
be arranged horizontally. So if we look at

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.885
our HTML code now, we notice we sort

01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:11.885
of just have these sections for If you're

01:10:11.885 --> 01:10:14.845
a type of cat and about me, they're

01:10:14.845 --> 01:10:18.125
just one after the other within the body.

01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:21.725
So the body is the smallest enclosing container

01:10:21.725 --> 01:10:23.420
for these two. But if we want to

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.620
arrange just those two horizontally, then we need

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:32.780
to have another div just for these just

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:38.465
to contain these two. And once we do

01:10:38.465 --> 01:10:43.265
this, we can create maybe another utility container

01:10:43.745 --> 01:10:47.745
called uflex. And then if we want it

01:10:47.745 --> 01:10:50.570
to be horizontal, we can first set it

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:54.490
to display flex and then we can choose

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:58.650
the flex direction to be row. And if

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:01.530
we do this and reload, we see that

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.895
they're now arranged in a row. And it

01:11:04.895 --> 01:11:06.335
turns out that you can actually also just

01:11:06.335 --> 01:11:10.735
delete this flex direction row attribute because flex

01:11:10.735 --> 01:11:14.175
defaults to having things in a row. So

01:11:14.335 --> 01:11:16.575
normally you actually just specify this if it's

01:11:16.575 --> 01:11:19.510
in a column and you'll get them in

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:21.110
a column. And you can also do things

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:25.590
like column reverse and we see if we

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:28.390
reload about me and favorite type of cat

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:35.225
flip. So that's the most basic way to

01:11:35.305 --> 01:11:38.505
use flex. We just set them up to

01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:43.225
be in a row and you can see

01:11:43.225 --> 01:11:46.105
the results if you check out step 11.

01:12:39.075 --> 01:12:42.390
I guess just to review, the way we

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:44.870
got it to be horizontal is we surrounded

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.190
our two sections within a larger div and

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:58.285
applied the flex utility class. Okay. I'll move

01:12:58.285 --> 01:13:00.925
on to some other, the other side of

01:13:00.925 --> 01:13:03.485
flex which is within the arrangement you can

01:13:03.485 --> 01:13:07.725
also control how large your boxes are. So

01:13:07.725 --> 01:13:11.070
reset hard and check out step 11. So

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:14.110
currently we have, our website looks like this.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.230
We have the two boxes sort of scrunched

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:20.510
up on the side and they're not exactly

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:22.910
what we want to have because the final,

01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:24.350
in the final case we want it both

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:30.585
sort of centered on each other sides. Flex

01:13:30.585 --> 01:13:33.465
is another, you can also control sizing with

01:13:33.465 --> 01:13:36.185
flex and if we look inside the CSS

01:13:36.185 --> 01:13:40.890
Tricks website, we have FlexGrow and we also

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:44.010
have FlexBasis. So if you read through these,

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:46.970
these are both ways to control how large

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:49.770
they grow. So FlexGrow sort of changes priority

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:52.330
for when things grow. So if you apply,

01:13:55.835 --> 01:13:57.755
if you set a value of two, then

01:13:57.755 --> 01:13:59.355
one of the sub containers will take up

01:13:59.355 --> 01:14:01.915
twice the size compared to the other ones

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:07.195
and flex basis is the default size before

01:14:07.435 --> 01:14:15.970
the things grow through flex grow. So with

01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:18.690
this in mind, maybe try to play around

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:21.570
with FlexBasys and FlexGrow and see if you

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:24.850
can get the two columns to be equally

01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:28.445
sized. And the main thing with flex is

01:14:28.445 --> 01:14:30.365
there are a ton of settings and the

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:31.725
best way to learn it is just playing

01:14:31.725 --> 01:14:33.885
around with your different boxes and get, trying

01:14:33.885 --> 01:14:35.325
to get things to look like the way

01:14:35.325 --> 01:14:44.780
you want them to look. And also as

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.540
a hint, you're going to want to probably

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.780
create some new classes because the way the

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.820
way FlexBasis and FlexGrow work is they're applied

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:58.205
to a sub container. So if you have

01:14:58.205 --> 01:15:00.285
the larger blue container, then you would apply

01:15:00.285 --> 01:15:03.165
a flex throw in flex basis to the

01:15:03.165 --> 01:17:47.385
classes of the sub containers within them. So

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.905
the way we're going to do this is

01:17:50.985 --> 01:17:53.145
we're going to create a sub container class.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:05.800
And we're going to set the flex grow

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.440
to one. And we're going to do this

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
so that both the elements and apply this

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.360
class to both of the elements within the

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.655
container so that they grow to the same

01:18:14.655 --> 01:18:19.775
amount. And then no default size for either

01:18:19.775 --> 01:18:25.375
of them. And so if we apply these

01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:28.810
classes now to the two sections, then we

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:30.730
reload, we see that they grow to the

01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:33.370
same size because they're given the same priority

01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:36.010
within the Flexbox since we applied the same

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:38.650
class to them and we get close to

01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:42.165
the desired result. And you can check out

01:18:42.165 --> 01:18:55.820
step 12 to get that result. Alright. So

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.140
that was pretty much it for this workshop.

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.380
I know there's a lot to it. There's

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.140
a lot of new CSS attributes that we

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.340
learned and combined with doing HTML for the

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:10.015
first time. But I hope you learned a

01:19:10.015 --> 01:19:12.095
lot of the main ideas from this workshop.

01:19:12.495 --> 01:19:16.095
Here are a couple of helpful links. Again,

01:19:16.095 --> 01:19:19.615
the CSS Tricks website is at weblab.isflex and

01:19:19.615 --> 01:19:21.215
has pretty much everything you need to know

01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:23.295
about Flex. I still reference it from time

01:19:23.295 --> 01:19:25.830
to time when I need to. And here's

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.990
some games. I've I've never played these actually,

01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:29.990
maybe you could check them out and see

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:35.110
if they're good. There's some additional styling that

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:39.405
you could do as extra homework afterwards, and

01:19:39.565 --> 01:19:43.085
it's in w zero step 13. And w

01:19:43.085 --> 01:19:45.725
zero complete has the full the w zero

01:19:45.725 --> 01:19:49.325
complete branch has the full Kafka profile page.

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:54.149
And we'll also do more CSS next week

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:59.270
in advanced CSS with Stanley. And a minute

01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:00.790
for feedback.
