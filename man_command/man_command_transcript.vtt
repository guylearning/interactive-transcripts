00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.560
Hi there. In this video we are going

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.160
to go over how to use the man

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.000
command, which is one of the more important

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.280
tools that you can use to find out

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.125
about various commands and also about standard library

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.005
functions for C. So man pages are pretty

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.085
nice. The easiest way to use one is

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.205
if you happen to know the command you're

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:20.965
looking for, you can type man and then

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:23.125
the name. So let's say man l s

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.205
looks like this and it gives you a

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:27.445
little description and it gives you all of

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.710
the various flags that you use for the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.950
program you're trying to look at. So it's

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.070
nice. And I'm just using the up and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.670
down arrow keys, you can also use the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.590
j to go down and the k to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.465
go back up, much like VIM which is

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:46.105
in a different video. And you can, keep

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:47.945
doing that, to find it. If you wanna

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.585
find something, you type the slash key, forward

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.385
slash, and notice I've typed forward slash down

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.065
here, and then you type something like, let's

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:56.345
say I wanted to find out what the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.550
dash a command did, I type slash then

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.070
dash a and then enter and it will

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.590
come up and over here that's not the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.270
one I'm looking for so I type n

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.030
lowercase n to go to the next one,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.225
that's not it. Let's see, I guess I'm

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.065
already too far down so if I because

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.345
I kept hitting n and it says pattern

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.665
not found but if I hit uppercase n

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:18.425
it will take me back to the top

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:21.145
and you can find that, there it is,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.860
dash a stands for do not ignore entries

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.340
starting with period which are your hidden files.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.300
So, there's also for instance dash uppercase a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.060
which is nice, just it still gives you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.980
the hidden files but not the two special

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.705
directories. So there you go. Now if you

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:40.785
wanna exit out of man, you just type

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:43.585
the q command and it will take you

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:44.865
back to where you are which is kinda

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:46.865
nice, it actually refreshes the screen back to

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.545
where you are. So if I have something

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:49.505
up here and I go, oh, how do

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:51.105
I wanna keep that screen and I type

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:52.990
man l s, when I type q it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.750
goes back and refreshes the screen to where

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.630
you are, so so that's nice. Now what

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.390
if you don't want to or you don't

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.070
know the actual command but you go, you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.230
know, I think something has to do with,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.635
print for instance, man dash k print and

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:09.955
it will it will, give you all the

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:12.995
different things. Man dash k means, find all

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.955
the commands that happen to, say something about

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.955
printing in them. So you'll notice there's lots

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:19.795
in here. I'm actually gonna do my regular

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:22.270
scroll up to see some of these. But,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.550
let's say I look through this and I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.390
go, oh, you know what? It's actually printf

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.550
that I'm looking for. If I type man

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.750
dash k printf, it'll give me just the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.310
printf commands. And you'll notice there's a couple

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.310
in here. Oh, it is just printf. So

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.785
man printf will give me the Unix command

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:42.505
print f, which says, oh, it's, you know,

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:44.505
you have formatting and you have options. It's

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:47.385
much like the c print f command actually.

00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:50.025
In fact, it'll do all the different, types

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:51.465
of things. So if I wanna just type

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:55.670
print f and then I type hello world

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.510
like that and then a new line it

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.110
will do hello world new line. I forgot

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.990
the new line by the way it will

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.150
do that and then put my prompt after

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.990
it like this probably not what you want

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.775
to do. Another similar command happens to be

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:10.335
echo which we use probably more often. Hello

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.815
world like that, we'll just echo hello world.

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:16.095
So anyway that's how you use that, synonym

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:21.420
for man k is actually apropos and then

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.420
printf and it will give you that. Now,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.260
if you notice by the way, printf, there's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.220
two of them here. Which one do we

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.500
look at? Well, the first one that comes

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.620
up is the one if you just type

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.140
man printf. But this means the type of,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.780
the part in the manual that it's actually

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.085
in. Three happens to be all of the

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.205
standard, the C standard library functions, which is

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:43.125
actually kind of cool. If you type man

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:46.565
three printf, it will tell you the how

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:49.045
to actually use it. So you have pound

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:53.390
includes studio dot h and then or s

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.390
t d I o dot h and then

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.790
you can use printf from there and it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.310
tells you how to do that. So for

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.950
instance, there's another one man three a t

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.625
o I, which actually stands for ASCII two

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.145
integer. So for some reason you wanted to

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.665
convert a string to an integer, this is

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:09.345
one way to do it in c and

00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:11.505
it will tell you, how to actually do

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.345
it. So that's kind of nice as well.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.519
So that's the man command, you should get

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.959
used to it and you should you will

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.719
use it frequently when you want to look

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.399
up various flags and options for commands. Thanks.
