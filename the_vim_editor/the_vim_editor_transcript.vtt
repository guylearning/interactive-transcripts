00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi there. This is going to be a

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.520
very quick tutorial on how to get up

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.160
to speed in the VIM editor, which is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.920
one of the common editors available on Unix

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.605
systems, the other being Emacs. I happen to

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:15.965
like them a lot, I think it's a

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:19.565
great editor and I use it extensively. But

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.445
some people don't love it. So I will

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:23.565
show you how to exit it if you

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.805
accidentally ever end up in VIM, which is

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:30.140
a common question. So one thing that, well

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.460
first things first, if you open, if you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.180
type VIM and then open a file, it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.420
will read the file, if the file doesn't

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.675
exist, it will create one for you. And

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:41.915
in VAM you start in what we call

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:45.115
command mode. And command mode means that you

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:48.475
can move around the file. I can either

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:52.290
move with the arrow keys or with the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.570
special keys on the home row, namely H,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.370
J, K, and L on the home row.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.930
Here's how it works. J goes down, K

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.090
goes up, H goes to the left, and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.525
L goes to the right. And the nice

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:06.645
thing about that is that you don't need

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:07.925
to move your hand from the home row,

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:10.165
so it's very, fast to actually go left,

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:12.405
right, etcetera. Some of the other keys that

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.605
are, interesting and also very accessible are, to

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:17.765
go to the next word, just type w

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.040
and it will go word by word and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.200
it defines words sometimes a little strangely but

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.640
it will go word to word by word.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.480
If you wanna go backwards through words, just

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.600
b, we'll go back through words. You can

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.440
also do things like control f to go

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.655
page down and control up, control b to

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:41.135
go page up. If you wanna go to

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.255
a particular line, you can just type colon

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:47.295
and then the line number. So colon seven

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:50.060
will go to line seven. You could also

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.620
type seven and then uppercase g. Let's try

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.260
a different one. Let's say, let's from here

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.420
let's go five uppercase g and it goes

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.620
right there. We could have also typed the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.405
colon key to do that. If you wanna

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:03.845
go to the top of the file, g

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:05.925
g, lowercase g, lowercase g gets right to

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.245
the top. Uppercase g on its own goes

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:09.925
right to the bottom of the file. So

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:13.045
lots of quick ways to get around the

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.450
file when you're in command mode. Okay? If

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.370
you actually do wanna type text and an

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.530
editor, you generally do, you can go into

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.330
what we call insert mode. And in insert

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.050
mode, you can, you just type the I

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.465
key and notice down here it actually says

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:32.185
that you are in insert mode and that

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:35.065
means that you can now type things. Okay,

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:37.865
like that. Alright. And you can use the

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.705
backspace key and so forth and the arrow

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.390
keys do work in command mode. In the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.230
original VI editor they did not as it

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.270
turns out but in here they do. And

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.470
so there's lots of other ones if you

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.390
wanna delete a line you hit d twice,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.310
d d deletes the line, etcetera. But lots

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.535
of people ask how do I exit VIM

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:59.415
because I'm not a VIM person. Well, first

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:01.495
things first to go out of insert mode.

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:02.615
If I was in insert mode, I wanna

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.295
go out of insert mode, I type the

00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:06.055
escape key. And I just hit the escape

00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:07.415
key and that takes us back to command

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:10.060
mode. And then to quit, you type colon

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.300
q and that will quit. Now, if there

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.900
are no changes that will quit. If I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.060
hit enter, it says no right since last

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.540
change, add exclamation point to override. So if

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.580
I did colon q exclamation point, it would

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.025
save without my changes. Let's say I actually

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.745
wanna save the changes, you can do colon

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.825
w, that will write the file and save

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.625
the changes like that. You can also do

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:36.025
colon w q, which will quit the, program

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:38.345
after writing the changes. I like to abbreviate

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:40.560
that with whatever reason this is the abbreviation,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.520
it's colon x means basically exit with saving

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.240
your changes. Okay, and that will exit you

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.080
out of VIM. Okay, what else can we

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.160
do with VIM that's kinda cool? We can

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.240
search for things. If you type slash and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.125
then start typing something like for instance, print

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.525
and then enter, it will jump to the

00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:01.085
first line that has print on it. If

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:02.285
I was back up at the top and

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:04.525
I just typed slash o, it will find

00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:06.125
the first instance of o, which is kind

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:07.245
of nice. But what if that wasn't the

00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:08.600
one I wanted to do? Well, all I

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.680
need to do is hit lowercase n and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.040
it will find the next one and lowercase

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.800
m will find the next one. If I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.480
keep hitting lowercase n, it'll just kind of

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.720
cycle through the whole file. If I wanna

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.000
go back to a previous o for instance,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.445
I would type shift n and that's how

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:28.005
it works. Okay. So very easy to find

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:30.165
things, very easy to do that. Other interesting

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.085
things, if I wanna start editing text at

00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:34.565
the end of this line, I can type

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.480
the a, uppercase a and I go into

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.840
insert mode at the end of the line.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.560
Sometimes that's important. Right? If I wanna go

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.840
to the beginning of the line in command

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.600
mode, I just type zero. If I wanna

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.120
go to the end, I type dollar sign

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.675
and you might be saying to yourself, these

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.915
are weird things to remember and I agree.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.355
Some of the things are a little bit

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:53.675
hard to remember the first few times you

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:55.355
do them but the more you get used

00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:57.915
to it the faster and faster you will

00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:04.560
be as you go through learning VIM. So

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.880
there's lots and lots to learn, you can

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.280
check out a zillion different tutorials online, in

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.000
fact there's a tutorial built into the Unix

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.525
system called VIMTutor which will bring up VimTutor

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.925
and it says here's how you actually do

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:21.605
it and if you scroll down it will

00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:23.365
say lesson one, moving the cursor and it

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.445
tells you how to move the cursor, etcetera,

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:29.765
etcetera. And you should maybe practice that if

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:34.380
you want. There is another very cool VIM

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.020
tutor if you want to go to the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.500
internet and type VIM adventures. Type VIM adventures

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.035
it will bring up a VIM adventures there

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.755
and it is a little game to show

00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:54.195
you how to do this. So you use

00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:57.555
the use the little keys, hooray, etcetera and

00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:00.310
you go and you you can look at

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.110
lots of different, fun things. And, there's sound

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.990
on here. I don't know if you can

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.430
hear the sound, you probably can't, but there's

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.590
sound coming through my headphones. So it's a

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.030
it's a fun game to learn how to

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.835
use VIM. So anyway, that's VIM. I think

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:15.315
it is a great editor. It does have

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:17.475
a bit of a steep learning curve. You

00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:19.555
don't learn VIM in one day, but if

00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:22.675
you keep learning, over time, you will become

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:25.075
very, very fast. And the other nice thing

00:06:25.075 --> 00:06:28.110
about VIM is it's available on virtually every

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.270
Linux system, kinda straight out of the box.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.350
If VIM isn't there, then VI is and

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.190
VI is, what VIM is based on. So

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.350
that is VIM. Thanks.
