00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.440
Hi there. In this video, we are gonna

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.160
talk about a very ubiquitous command called cat,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.440
which stands for concatenate. And it allows you

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.495
to quickly look at a file that's on

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:15.655
your system and print it to the screen.

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:17.735
That's really all it does. It's actually called

00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:20.935
concatenate because if you, use the command on

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:22.615
multiple files, it prints one after the other

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:24.695
after the other and puts them all together

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.500
into one long list of files. So let's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.060
take a look here. I'm gonna change directories

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.580
into my CS107 directory and then assignments and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.780
assignment zero folder and in here I have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.135
a couple of different files here And, in

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:46.135
fact, let's actually do the long list of

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:47.895
files. So I've got a I've got a

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:51.415
hello c file which is, just a c

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:54.215
program. I've got a hello binary file which

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.900
is your program once it's been compiled And

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.380
I've got some other types of files as

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.140
well. So if I type cat and then

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.780
hello dot c, it actually just prints to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.420
the screen. And that's really the the extent

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.885
of the command. You can actually type hello

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:14.285
dot c followed by readme dot t x

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:15.805
t and it will print both of them

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:17.645
out there and the readme have lots of

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:21.405
text in it. So that's really about it.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.060
You'll use the cat command very often to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.380
to view files like that. You can't do

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.420
well, if you type cat inner folder, it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.705
will say it's a directory. So that's not,

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:36.625
you can't cat a directory because it doesn't

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:40.865
make any sense. You can actually, you could

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:43.185
cat hello which is the binary file. You

00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:44.625
don't actually want to do this, watch what

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.505
happens when I do this, right? It's garbage

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.530
and in my headset right now I'm getting

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.770
lots of like beeps and things because nothing's

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.730
actually there. That's your actually your compiled program

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.730
and so that doesn't doesn't actually make sense

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.865
to cat that. But if you cat regular

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:04.105
old text files, you can do that. Another

00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:06.985
command that's very similar in the sense of

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.945
viewing a file is called less. There's another

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:11.705
one called more, but less is the one

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:14.265
I like to use. And less will bring

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:17.270
up the file and allow you to actually

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.270
scroll through it. I'm I'm actually scrolling through

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.070
it, but I can't tell in this case.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.230
So, you can do that and then it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.150
quit. It's just it's more or less the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.895
no pun intended using the same interface as

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:37.095
the man command. So, that's that. That's the

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:38.375
cat command. Thanks.
