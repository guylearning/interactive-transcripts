00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.640
Talks about learning technology often center on technology.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.280
So instead, I'd like to begin by asking:

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.840
What do you want learning to be like

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:15.545
for yourself? If you could just snap your

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:19.465
fingers and have the ideal perfect learning environment,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.865
what would that be like? One way to

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.265
start getting at this question is to ask,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.910
what were the most rewarding high growth periods

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.910
of your life? I've noticed two patterns when

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.605
I ask people this question. First, people will

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.205
tell me about a period in their life

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:44.565
where they learned a ton, but where learning

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:48.085
wasn't the point. Instead, they were totally immersed

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:49.845
in some project with a great deal of

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:52.885
personal meaning, like a scrappy startup or a

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:56.260
research project or an artistic urge or just

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.420
a fiery curiosity. And a lot of learning

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.820
happened just along the way. They learned whatever

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.740
they needed. They dove in. They got their

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.915
hands dirty. Secondly, in these stories, learning really

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:15.675
worked. People emerged feeling transformed, newly capable, filled

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.915
with insights that remained with them years later.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.650
These stories are so vivid in part because

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.210
learning rarely feels this way. People are often

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.210
telling me somewhat wistfully about an experience that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.170
occurred years or decades earlier. Learning rarely feels

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.265
so subordinated to an authentic pursuit. Often if

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.345
we try to just dive in, we dive

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:38.425
into a brick wall, or we find ourselves

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.465
uneasily cargo culting others without any real understanding

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:44.745
of what's actually going on. So why can't

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:48.080
we just dive in all the time? Instead,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.600
it often feels like we have to put

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.680
our aims on hold while we go do

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.840
some homework and learn properly. And worse, learning

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.280
so often just doesn't really work. We take

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.095
the class, we read the book, And then

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:03.295
when we try to put that knowledge into

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.575
practice, we find that it's fragile. It doesn't

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.255
transfer well. Worse, we'll often find that we've

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.695
forgotten half of it by the time we

00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:14.255
try to use it. Why does learning so

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:19.080
often fail to actually work? These questions connect

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080
to an age old conflict among educators and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.280
learning scientists between implicit learning, also known as

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.040
discovery learning, inquiry learning, situated learning, and guided

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.760
learning, which is often represented by cognitive scientists

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.600
of the kind we find here at UCSD.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.855
Advocates of implicit learning methods argue that we

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:40.175
should prioritize discovery, motivation, authentic involvement, and being

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.135
situated in a community of practice. In the

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:46.175
opposing camp, cognitive psychologists argue that you really

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:47.855
do need to pay attention to the architecture

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.360
of cognition, to long term memory, to procedural

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.800
fluency, and to scaffold appropriately for cognitive load.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.640
In my view, each of these of view

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.195
contains a lot of truth. And they also

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:07.195
ignore each other to their detriment. Implicit learning

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:10.875
aptly recognizes meaning and emotion but ignores the

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.515
often decisive constraints of cognition what we need

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:17.290
to actually make learning work. Guided learning advocates

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.930
are focused on making learning work, and they

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.450
sometimes succeed, but usually by sacrificing that purposeful

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.690
sense of immersion that we love about those

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.835
rewarding high growth periods. One obvious approach is

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.715
to try compromise. Project based learning is a

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:35.435
good representation of that. By creating a scaffolded

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:37.595
series of projects, the suggestion is that we

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.275
can get some of the benefits of implicit

00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:44.620
learning authenticity, motivation, transferability while also getting the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.500
instructional control and the cognitive awareness that might

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.860
be typical of traditional courses. The trouble is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.620
that usually we get the worst of both

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.915
worlds. I remember when I was in college,

00:03:57.915 --> 00:03:59.755
I was interested in three d game programming,

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:01.275
so I signed up for a project based

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.635
course on computer graphics. The trouble was that

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:07.675
those projects weren't my projects. So a few

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:10.260
weeks in, I ended up implementing array marching

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.060
for more efficient bump mapping. And unfortunately, I

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.220
was really just implementing some math that I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.660
was handed because this course was trying to

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.500
take project based learning seriously. So there weren't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700
long textbook readings, weren't long problem sets. But

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.055
I didn't understand the math. What What I

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.335
ended up with was a project that I

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:27.655
didn't care about implementing something I didn't understand.

00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:31.975
Instead, I suggest, we should take both views

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.935
seriously. Find a way to synthesize the two.

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:38.055
You really do want to make doing the

00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:41.720
thing the primary activity. But the realities of

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.520
cognitive psychology mean that in many cases, you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.120
really do need explicit guidance, scaffolding, practice, intention

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.280
and memory support. Learning by immersion works naturalistically

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:53.975
when the material has a low enough complexity

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:55.895
relative to your prior knowledge that you can

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.975
successfully process it on the fly and when

00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:02.695
natural participation routinely reinforces everything important, giving you

00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:05.970
fluency. When those conditions aren't satisfied, which is

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.410
most of the time, you will need some

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.530
support. You want to just dive in. And

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.650
you want learning to actually work. To make

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.650
that happen, we need to infuse your authentic

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.115
projects with guided support, where necessary, inspired by

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:21.515
the best ideas from cognitive science. And if

00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:24.875
there's something that requires more focused, explicit learning,

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.275
then you want those experiences to be utterly

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:32.060
in service to your actual aims. Now I've

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.980
been thinking about this synthesis for many years,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.740
and honestly, I've mostly been pretty stuck. Recently

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.900
though, I've been thinking a lot about AI,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.100
which I know gets an eye roll. Certainly

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:47.285
every mention of AI in education gets an

00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:50.165
eye roll from me. But I confess, the

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.205
possibility of AI has helped me finally get

00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:55.765
what feels like some traction on this particular

00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:58.085
problem. So I'd like to share some of

00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:01.540
those early concepts today. We'll explore this possible

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.060
synthesis through a story in six parts. Meet

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.660
Sam. Sam studied computer science in university, and

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.420
they're now working as a software engineer at

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.655
a big tech company. But Sam is bored

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:17.935
at their day job. Not everything is boring,

00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:20.015
though. Every time Sam sees a tweet announcing

00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:22.415
new results in brain computer interfaces, they're absolutely

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:25.375
captivated. These projects seem so much more interesting

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:28.050
than what they're doing by day. Sam pulls

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.370
up the papers looking for some way to

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.690
contribute, but they hit a brick wall with

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.690
so many unfamiliar topics all at once. What

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.850
if Sam could ask for help finding some

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.375
meaningful way to start participating? With Sam's permission,

00:06:43.615 --> 00:06:45.695
our AI, and let's assume it's a local

00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:47.775
AI, can build up a huge amount of

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:50.975
context about their background. From old documents on

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:53.215
Sam's hard drive, our AI knows all about

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:55.600
their university coursework. It can see their current

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.160
skills through work projects. It knows something about

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.000
Sam's interests through their browsing history. So it

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.160
suggests a few ideas, and Sam is excited

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.240
about the idea of reproducing the paper's data

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.400
analysis. That seems to play to their strengths.

00:07:09.765 --> 00:07:12.565
They notice that the authors use a custom

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.805
Python package to do their analysis, but that

00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:17.525
code was never published. And that seems intriguing.

00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:20.405
Sam has built open source tools before. Maybe

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:22.405
they could contribute here by building an open

00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:25.950
source version of this signal processing pipeline. So

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.390
Sam dives in. They've found an open access

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.270
dataset, and they've taken the first steps to

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.950
start working with it. Tools like Copilot help

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.030
Sam get started. But to follow some of

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.185
these signal processing steps, what Sam really needs

00:07:40.185 --> 00:07:43.945
here is something like Copilot, but with awareness

00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:46.025
of the paper in addition to the code

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:48.345
and with context about what Sam's actually trying

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:52.985
to do. This AI system isn't trapped in

00:07:52.985 --> 00:07:55.110
its own chat box or in the sidebar

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.590
of one application. It can see what's going

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.310
on across multiple applications, and it can propose

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.790
actions across multiple applications. Sam can click that

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.430
button to view a change set with the

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.945
potential implementation. Here that is. And then they

00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:13.985
can continue the conversation, smoothly switching into the

00:08:13.985 --> 00:08:17.105
context of the code editor. Like, what is

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:21.745
this axis equals one parameter? The explanation depends

00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:24.670
on context from the code editor, from the

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.470
paper being implemented, and also the documentation that

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.470
came with the data set Sam's working with.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.630
The AI underlines assumptions made based on specific

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.495
information and turns those things into links. So

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:39.815
Sam can click on that in this dataset

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:42.775
link, and our AI opens the ReadMe to

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:46.135
the relevant line. All this is to support

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:48.775
our central aim, which is that Sam can

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:52.230
immerse themselves as much as possible in what

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.110
they're actually trying to do, but get the

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.830
support they need to understand what they're doing.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.790
And that support doesn't have to just mean

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.365
text. Sam next needs to implement a downsampling

00:09:05.365 --> 00:09:09.605
stage. And this time, guidance includes synthesized dynamic

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:12.645
media so that Sam can understand what downsampling

00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:16.520
does through scaffolded immersion. Doesn't need to read

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.920
an abstract explanation and try to imagine what

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.320
that would do to different signals. Instead, as

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.560
they try different sampling rates, real time feedback

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.720
can help them internalize the effect on different

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.165
signals. By playing with the dynamic media, Sam

00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:31.685
notices that some of the peaks are lost

00:09:31.685 --> 00:09:36.245
when the signal is downsampled. These dynamic media

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:39.285
aren't trapped in the chat box. They're using

00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:42.005
the same input data and libraries that Sam

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:44.240
is using in their notebook. So at any

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.640
time, Sam can just view source to tinker

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.560
with this figure or to use some of

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:55.360
its code in their own notebook. Now Sam

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.045
presses on. But as they dig into bandpass

00:10:00.045 --> 00:10:03.165
filters, the high level explanations they can get

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:06.125
from these short chat interactions really just don't

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:09.805
feel like enough. What is a frequency domain?

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:12.910
What is a Nyquist rate? Sam can copy

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.150
and paste some AI generated code all day,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.230
but they don't understand what's going on at

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.590
all. A chat interface is just not a

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.670
great medium for long form conceptual explanation. It's

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.045
time here for something deeper. Now, our AI

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.765
knows Sam's background and aims here, so it

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.645
suggests an appropriate undergraduate text with a practical

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:38.885
focus. And more importantly, the AI reassures Sam

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.490
that they don't necessarily need to read this

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.410
entire thousand page book right now. It focuses

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.130
on Sam's goal here and suggests a range

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.930
of accessible paths that Sam can choose according

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.690
to how deeply they would like to understand

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.135
this material. The AI has made a personal

00:10:56.135 --> 00:10:58.775
map in the book's table of contents so

00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:00.855
that if Sam, for instance, just wants to

00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:03.895
understand what these filters are doing and why,

00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:06.535
there's a 25 page path for that. But

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:08.375
if they want to know the mathematical background

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.040
how these filters work, there's a deeper path.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.480
And if they want to actually be able

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.440
to implement them themselves, there's an even deeper

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.600
path. You can choose a journey here. When

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.760
Sam digs into the book, you'll find notes

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.360
from the AI at the start of each

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.015
section and scattered throughout, which ground the material

00:11:26.015 --> 00:11:30.255
in Sam's context, Sam's project, Sam's purpose. This

00:11:30.255 --> 00:11:31.695
section will help you understand how to think

00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:34.255
about signals in terms of frequency spectra. That's

00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:38.360
what low pass filters manipulate. Sam is spending

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.960
some time away from their project in a

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.400
more traditionally instructional setting. But that doesn't mean

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.640
the experience has to lose its connection to

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.600
their authentic purpose. Incidentally, I've heard some technologists

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.280
suggest that we should just use AI to

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.505
synthesize the whole book. We'll get per person

00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:58.545
bespoke textbooks. But I think that there's actually

00:11:58.545 --> 00:12:00.625
a huge amount of value in having shared

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:03.265
canonical artifacts. In any given field, there are

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:05.185
key texts that we can all point to,

00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:06.705
and they form a common ground for the

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:09.460
culture. I think we can preserve that by

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.860
layering personalized context on top as a lens

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.260
like this. In my ideal future, of course,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.540
our canonical shared artifacts are dynamic media, not

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.035
digital representations of dead trees. But until all

00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:25.515
of our canonical works are rewritten as a

00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:27.835
transitional measure, we can at least wave our

00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:30.155
hands and imagine that our AI could synthesize

00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:32.795
dynamic media versions of figures like this one.

00:12:33.755 --> 00:12:35.780
Now, as Sam reads through the book, they

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.300
can continue to engage with the text by

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.260
asking questions as before, and our AI's responses

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.660
will continue to be grounded in their project.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.420
As Sam highlights the text or makes comments

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.980
about details which seem particularly important or surprising,

00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:52.005
those annotations won't end up trapped inside the

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:54.965
PDF. Instead, they will feed into future discussions

00:12:54.965 --> 00:12:58.885
and practice, as we'll see later. In addition

00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:01.525
to Sam asking questions of the AI, the

00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:03.845
AI can insert questions for Sam to consider,

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.460
again grounded in their project, to promote deeper

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.140
processing of the material. And just as our

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.460
AI guided Sam to the right sections of

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.020
this thousand page book, it can point out

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.740
which exercises might be most valuable, considering both

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.355
Sam's background and their aims. Better, it can

00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:26.635
connect the exercises to Sam's aims so that

00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:30.555
aspirationally, doing those problems feels continuous with Sam's

00:13:30.555 --> 00:13:34.395
authentic practice. Even if the exercises do still

00:13:34.395 --> 00:13:37.970
feel somewhat decontextualized, Sam can at least feel

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.730
more confident that the work is going to

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.810
help them do what they want to do.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.890
So Sam ends the day with some rewarding

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.690
progress on their project and a newfound understanding

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.695
of quite a few topics. But this isn't

00:13:51.695 --> 00:13:55.855
yet robust knowledge. SAM has very little fluency.

00:13:55.855 --> 00:13:58.015
If they try to use this material seriously,

00:13:58.015 --> 00:14:00.175
they'll probably feel like they're standing on shaky

00:14:00.175 --> 00:14:04.820
ground. And more prosaically, they will probably forget

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.500
much of what they just learned. So I'd

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.700
like to focus on memory for a bit

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.700
here. It's worth asking, why do we sometimes

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.795
remember conceptual material and sometimes not? Often we

00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:20.275
take a class or read a book or

00:14:20.275 --> 00:14:22.755
even just look something up and find that

00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:24.835
a short time later we have retained almost

00:14:24.835 --> 00:14:28.675
nothing. But sometimes things seem to stick. Why

00:14:28.675 --> 00:14:32.950
is that? There are some easier cases. If

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.550
you're learning something new in a domain that

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.790
you know well, each new fact connects to

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.270
lots of prior knowledge, and that creates more

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.470
cues for recall and more opportunities for reinforcement.

00:14:42.985 --> 00:14:45.145
Likewise, if you're in some setting where you

00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:47.545
need that knowledge every single day, you will

00:14:47.545 --> 00:14:49.865
find that your memory becomes reliable pretty quickly.

00:14:50.665 --> 00:14:53.625
Conceptual material like what Sam just learned doesn't

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:57.000
usually get reinforced every day like that. But

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.280
sometimes the world conspires to give those memories

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.200
the reinforcement it needs. Sometimes you read about

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.680
a topic, and then later in that evening,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.000
that topic comes up in conversation with the

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.535
collaborator. You have to retrieve what you learned,

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:15.735
and that retrieval reinforces the memory. Then, maybe

00:15:15.735 --> 00:15:18.215
two days later, it comes up again. You

00:15:18.215 --> 00:15:20.135
need to recall that knowledge for a project.

00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:23.175
Each time you reinforce the memory this way,

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:26.050
you forget it more slowly. Now perhaps a

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.810
week can go by and you're still likely

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.450
to remember, then maybe a few weeks, then

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.650
a few months, and so on. With a

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.450
surprisingly small number of retrievals, if they're placed

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.425
close enough to avoid forgetting, you can retain

00:15:39.425 --> 00:15:43.185
that knowledge for months or years. By contrast,

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.425
sometimes when you learn something, it doesn't come

00:15:45.425 --> 00:15:48.065
up again until, say, the next week. Then

00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:49.825
you try to retrieve the knowledge, but maybe

00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:52.145
it's already been forgotten. So you have to

00:15:52.145 --> 00:15:54.630
look it up. Looking it up doesn't reinforce

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.190
your memory very much. And then if it

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.430
doesn't come up again for a while longer,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.270
you may still not remember the next time.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.110
So you have to look it up again.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.710
And so on. The key insight here is

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.095
that it's possible to arrange the timeline for

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:14.895
yourself. And of course, courses sometimes do when

00:16:14.895 --> 00:16:17.535
each problem set consistently interleaves knowledge from the

00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:22.175
prior problem sets. But immersive learning and for

00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:25.440
that matter, most learning usually doesn't arrange this

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.360
properly, so you usually forget a lot. What

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.000
if this kind of reinforcement were woven into

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.925
the grain of the learning region? Collaborator Michael

00:16:36.925 --> 00:16:39.725
Nielsen and I created a quantum computing primer,

00:16:39.725 --> 00:16:43.965
Quantum Country, to explore this idea. It's available

00:16:43.965 --> 00:16:46.845
for free online. If you head to quantum.country,

00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:48.045
you'll see what looks at first like a

00:16:48.045 --> 00:16:54.410
normal book. And after a few minutes of

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.010
reading, the text is interrupted with a small

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.090
set of review questions. They're designed to take

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.165
just a few seconds each. Think the answer

00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.565
to yourself. Then mark whether or not you

00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:10.005
were able to answer correctly. And so far,

00:17:10.005 --> 00:17:12.885
these look like simple flashcards. But as we've

00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:15.125
discussed, even if you can answer these questions

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:16.965
now, that doesn't mean you'll be able to

00:17:16.965 --> 00:17:18.850
in a few weeks or even in a

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.370
few days. So notice these markings at the

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.210
bottom of each question. These represent intervals. So

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.050
you practice the questions while you're reading the

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.530
text. Then one week later, you'll get an

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.770
email that says, Hey, you have probably started

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.275
to forget some of what you've learned. Do

00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:36.875
you want to take five minutes to quickly

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:40.075
review that material again? Each time you answer

00:17:40.075 --> 00:17:42.715
successfully, the interval increases to a few weeks

00:17:42.715 --> 00:17:45.195
and a few months and so on. If

00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:47.675
you begin to forget, then the intervals tighten

00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:50.920
up to provide more reinforcement. Now you may

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.320
have seen systems like this before. Language learners

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.560
and medical students in particular often use tools

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.840
called spaced repetition memory systems to remember vocabulary

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.405
and basic facts. But the same cognitive mechanisms

00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:05.365
should work for more complex conceptual knowledge as

00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:10.005
well. There are 112 of these questions scattered

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:12.085
throughout the first chapter of the book on

00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:14.990
that basis. Quantum country is a kind of

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.430
new medium, a mnemonic medium, integrating a spaced

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.270
repetition memory system with an explanatory text aspirationally

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.350
to make it easier for people to absorb

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.735
complex material reliably. We now have millions of

00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:30.735
practice data points, so we can start to

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:34.175
see how well it's working. This plot shows

00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:36.415
the amount of time spent practicing on the

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:41.480
x axis versus the reader's demonstrated retention that

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.920
is, how long a reader was able to

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.240
go without practicing and still answer at least

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.400
90% of questions correctly. These five dots represent

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.000
the median user's first five repetitions for the

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.905
first chapter. Notice that the y axis is

00:18:55.905 --> 00:18:58.545
logarithmic, so this straight line plot we're seeing

00:18:58.545 --> 00:19:01.665
here represents a very nice exponential growth. Each

00:19:01.665 --> 00:19:05.025
extra repetition, which is a constant extra time

00:19:05.025 --> 00:19:09.460
input, yields increasing output, I. E. Retention. And

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.100
so in exchange for about an hour and

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.500
a half of total practice, the median reader

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.220
was able to correctly answer over 100 detailed

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.860
questions about the first chapter after more than

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.655
two months without any practice. Now, the first

00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:26.295
chapter takes most readers about four hours to

00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:29.255
read the first time. So this plot implies

00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:31.895
that an extra overhead of less than 50%

00:19:31.895 --> 00:19:35.815
in time commitment can yield months or years

00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:39.840
of detailed retention. It's also interesting to explore

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.880
the counterfactual: how much would people have forgotten

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.000
if they didn't have this extra reinforcement? So

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.720
as an experiment, we removed nine questions from

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.785
the first chapter for some readers and then

00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:53.905
covertly reinserted the questions one month later into

00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:57.185
their practice sessions. This graph shows what happened.

00:19:57.985 --> 00:20:01.185
These nine points represent those nine questions. The

00:20:01.185 --> 00:20:03.345
y axis shows the percentage of readers who

00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:05.580
are able to answer that correctly after one

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.140
month with no support at all. You can

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.460
see that some questions are harder than others.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.980
All the way over here on the left,

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.900
one month later, the majority of readers missed

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.940
the hardest three questions. And about thirty percent

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.420
missed the middle three, about fifteen percent missed

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.235
the easiest three. We can compare these to

00:20:23.235 --> 00:20:25.555
another group of users who got practice while

00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:27.235
reading the essay, like we saw in the

00:20:27.235 --> 00:20:30.115
video a moment ago. And for any questions

00:20:30.115 --> 00:20:31.475
they missed, they got a bonus round of

00:20:31.475 --> 00:20:34.355
practice the next day. Then these questions disappeared

00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:36.870
for a month, at which point we tested.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.550
These readers performed noticeably better, though a big

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.550
chunk of them are still missing several of

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.710
these questions. Now, here's one last group, like

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.365
the previous one, except they got just one

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:51.365
extra round of practice a week after reading

00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:53.445
the book. Then we tested them again at

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:54.645
the one month mark, and that's what you're

00:20:54.645 --> 00:20:58.085
seeing here. Each question takes six seconds on

00:20:58.085 --> 00:21:00.325
average to answer. So this is less than

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.565
a minute of extra practice in total for

00:21:02.565 --> 00:21:04.960
these nine questions. But now, for all of

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.800
these questions, at least 90% of readers were

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.640
able to answer correctly. Of course, some readers

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.240
have a much easier time than others. So

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.560
the left plot here focuses on the bottom

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.895
quartile of users. That is, the readers who

00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:21.735
missed the most questions while they were first

00:21:21.735 --> 00:21:24.055
reading the essay. Notice that I've had to

00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:26.695
lengthen the y axis downwards here because we

00:21:26.695 --> 00:21:28.935
can see that without any practice at all,

00:21:29.415 --> 00:21:31.255
most of these people in the bottom quartile

00:21:31.255 --> 00:21:33.735
forgot two thirds of these held out questions.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.170
If they only had in essay practice, roughly

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.570
half of them were left for getting roughly

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.490
half of the questions. And here, with just

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.890
one extra round of practice, that extra slightly

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.155
less than a minute of extra practice, even

00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:52.875
this bottom quartile of readers performs quite well,

00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:59.035
almost as well as the overall population. So

00:21:59.035 --> 00:22:02.155
this is the power of practice efficient practice,

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:05.570
at least. And this mechanism is useful for

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.010
more than just quantum computing. In my personal

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.570
practice, I have accumulated thousands and thousands of

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.090
questions. I write questions about scientific papers, about

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.835
conversations, about lectures, about memorable meals. I will

00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:20.675
definitely be writing a bunch about meetings I've

00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:23.395
had here today. All of this makes my

00:22:23.395 --> 00:22:26.595
daily life more rewarding because I know that

00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.915
if I invest my intention in something, I

00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:32.920
will internalize it indefinitely. Central to this is

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.880
the idea of a daily ritual, a vessel

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.360
for practice. Like meditation or exercise, I spend

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.440
about ten minutes a day using this memory

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.135
system. And because these exponential schedules are very

00:22:46.135 --> 00:22:49.095
efficient, those ten minutes are enough to maintain

00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:51.735
my memory for thousands of these questions and

00:22:51.735 --> 00:22:53.415
to allow me to add about 40 new

00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:57.850
questions every day. But there are some problems.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.450
So I want to mention a few of

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:04.010
these problems. One is pattern matching. Once a

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.490
question comes up a few times, I may

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.050
recognize the text of the question without really

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.165
thinking about its meaning. This creates the unpleasant

00:23:12.165 --> 00:23:15.205
feeling of parroting. But more importantly, I suspect

00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:17.925
it often leaves my memory brittle. I'll remember

00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:20.805
the answer, but only when queued exactly as

00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:23.445
I've practiced it. I wish the questions had

00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:28.050
more variability. Likewise, the questions are necessarily somewhat

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.570
abstract. When I face a real problem in

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.690
this domain, I won't always recognize what knowledge

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.530
I should use or how to adapt it

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.515
to that medium. A cognitive scientist would say

00:23:39.515 --> 00:23:43.275
maybe that I need to acquire schemas. Now,

00:23:43.275 --> 00:23:45.915
unless I intervene, these questions stay the same

00:23:45.915 --> 00:23:49.355
over years. They're maintaining my memory, but ideally

00:23:49.355 --> 00:23:52.395
they would push for further processing, increasing depth

00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:56.530
over time. And finally, returning to this talk's

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.970
thesis, memory systems are too often disconnected from

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.090
my authentic practice, what I'm actually interested in.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.490
Say I'm studying a topic in signal processing

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.610
for a creative project. Unless I'm very careful,

00:24:09.825 --> 00:24:11.665
the questions that I get from that probably

00:24:11.665 --> 00:24:14.465
won't feel very connected to my project. They

00:24:14.465 --> 00:24:17.265
will probably feel like generic textbook questions about

00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:23.265
signal processing. Let's return to SAM now and

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.880
see if we can apply some of these

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.720
ideas about practice and memory. So Sam did

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.200
the work to study that signal processing material.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.960
They want to make sure it actually sticks.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.240
How might that work? Let's say they can

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.715
install a home screen widget, which ambiently exposes

00:24:38.715 --> 00:24:42.555
them to practice prompts drawn from highlights, questions

00:24:42.555 --> 00:24:45.035
asked, and any other activity that the AI

00:24:45.035 --> 00:24:48.155
can access. Sam can flip through these questions

00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:49.995
while waiting in line or on the bus.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.540
And notice that this isn't a generic textbook

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.180
signal processing question. It's actually grounded in the

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.140
details of Sam's brain computer interface project so

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.260
that, at least aspirationally, practice feels somewhat more

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:08.415
continuous with authentic doing. These synthesized prompts can

00:25:08.415 --> 00:25:10.575
vary each time they're asked so that Sam

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:15.215
gets practice accessing the same idea from different

00:25:15.215 --> 00:25:21.580
angles. The prompts get deeper and more complex

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.300
over time as Sam gets more confident with

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.980
the material. Notice also that this question isn't

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.580
so abstract. It's really about applying what Sam

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.820
has learned in a bite sized form factor

00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:38.085
that can do anywhere. Now the widget can

00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:40.805
also include kind of more open ended discussion

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:44.805
questions. Why do we think Metzger et al

00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:50.260
downsampled their signals to 200 Hertz? Maybe it's

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.140
for performance? Here Sam gets some elaborative feedback

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.620
and extra detail to consider in their answer.

00:26:00.165 --> 00:26:02.245
Now when questions are synthesized like this, it's

00:26:02.245 --> 00:26:04.805
important that Sam can steer them with feedback

00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:09.445
assuring that future questions are synthesized accordingly. Because

00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:11.045
again, what we're trying to do here is

00:26:11.045 --> 00:26:13.285
to make all of this not be homework,

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:15.250
but to actually support what Sam is really

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.090
trying to do. So far we've been looking

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.010
at bite sized questions Sam can answer while

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.250
they're out and about. But if they make

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.250
time for a longer dedicated session, we can

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.735
suggest meatier tasks like this one. And what's

00:26:28.735 --> 00:26:30.495
more, we can move that work out of

00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:33.935
fake practice land and into Sam's real context

00:26:33.935 --> 00:26:37.535
here at Jupyter Notebook. Notice that the task

00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:39.695
is still framed in terms of Sam's specific

00:26:39.695 --> 00:26:42.815
aims rather than some generic signal processing pipeline.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.830
Now, Sam got into this project not as

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.790
a learning exercise, but as a way to

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.150
start legitimately participating to start working with BCIs

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.465
while playing to existing strengths. So just as

00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:59.545
our AI can help Sam find a tractable

00:26:59.545 --> 00:27:01.785
way into this space, it can also facilitate

00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:04.665
connections to communities of practice, here suggesting a

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:07.865
local neurotech meetup. So let's say Sam goes

00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:10.425
to this meetup, meets a local scientist, and

00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:13.840
sets up a coffee date. With permission, Sam

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.720
records the meeting, knowing the notes will probably

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.040
be helpful later. And of course, Sam ends

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.600
up surprised and intrigued quite a lot in

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.160
this conversation. Our AI can notice these moments

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.865
of surprise and help Sam metabolize them. Here,

00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:33.345
that insight turns into a reflective practice prompt.

00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:39.425
Four big design principles are threaded through Sam's

00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:41.610
story. I'd like to review them now, and

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.610
for each, point out the ways that AI

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.330
has helped me think about them. First, we

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.330
bring guided learning to authentic contexts rather than

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.035
thinking about it as a separate activity. We're

00:27:55.035 --> 00:27:56.955
able to make that happen by imagining an

00:27:56.955 --> 00:27:59.755
AI which can perceive and act across applications

00:27:59.755 --> 00:28:02.955
on Sam's computer. And as the audio transcript

00:28:02.955 --> 00:28:04.875
at the end of the story here alluded

00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:08.155
to, that action can potentially extend to activities

00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:11.670
outside of the computer as well. The AI

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.630
can give appropriate guidance in part because, with

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.510
permission and executing locally, it can learn from

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.670
every piece of text that has ever crossed

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.870
Sam's screen, every action they've ever taken on

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:27.315
the computer. It can synthesize scaffolded dynamic media

00:28:27.315 --> 00:28:29.955
so that Sam can learn by doing, but

00:28:29.955 --> 00:28:35.475
with guidance. And then, when explicit learning activities

00:28:35.475 --> 00:28:38.915
are necessary, we suffuse them with authentic context.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.810
The AI in our story grounds all of

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.730
the reading and practice Sam's doing in their

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.930
actual aims. It helps Sam match the learning

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.130
activities to their depth of interest. And it

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.930
draws on important moments that happen while Sam

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.745
is doing, like insights from that coffee meeting

00:28:56.745 --> 00:28:59.545
at the end or questions asked while implementing

00:28:59.545 --> 00:29:02.105
parts of the project. And it brings those

00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:06.585
moments into study activities. Besides connecting these two

00:29:06.585 --> 00:29:09.225
domains, we can also strengthen each of them.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.120
So our AI suggests tractable ways for Sam

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.920
to just dive in to a new interest.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.880
And it helps Sam build connections with a

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.605
community of practice. On the other side, when

00:29:23.605 --> 00:29:25.925
we are spending time in explicit learning activities,

00:29:25.925 --> 00:29:29.125
let's make sure that they actually work. So

00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:31.685
our AI creates a dynamic vessel for ongoing

00:29:31.685 --> 00:29:35.445
reinforcement. It varies what's in that vessel over

00:29:35.445 --> 00:29:37.870
time so that knowledge transfers more effectively to

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.790
real situations. And it doesn't just maintain memory.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:47.230
It increases depth of understanding over time. Now

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.710
I'd like to give two cheers for chatbot

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.815
tutors. Most discussion of AI and education at

00:29:53.815 --> 00:29:55.815
the moment revolves around the framing of chatbot

00:29:55.815 --> 00:29:58.455
tutors. And I think this framing correctly identifies

00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:01.335
something really wonderful about language models, which is

00:30:01.335 --> 00:30:03.495
that they are so good at answering long

00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:06.290
tail questions if the user can articulate the

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.690
question clearly enough. And if the user is

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.410
trying to perform a routine task, chatbot tutors

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.970
can often diagnose problems and find good ways

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.210
to get the user unstuck. And that's great.

00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:19.025
But when I look at others' visions of

00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:21.825
chatbot tutors through the broader framing that we've

00:30:21.825 --> 00:30:24.545
been discussing, they're clearly missing a lot of

00:30:24.545 --> 00:30:27.825
what I want. I think these visions often

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.505
fail to take seriously just how much a

00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:32.080
real tutor can really do. Large part, I

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.680
think that's because the authors of these visions

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.440
are usually thinking about educating, something they want

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.120
to do to others rather than learning, something

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.475
they want for themselves. Now a sad truth

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:46.395
about the world is that postdocs and graduate

00:30:46.395 --> 00:30:49.595
students are incredibly underpaid. So it is actually

00:30:49.595 --> 00:30:51.595
surprisingly affordable to get an expert tutor for

00:30:51.595 --> 00:30:54.955
a technical topic I care about. But if

00:30:54.955 --> 00:30:56.635
I hire a real tutor as an adult

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.860
to learn about signal processing, I will tell

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.260
them about my interest in brain computer interfaces.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.180
And I will expect them to ground every

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.980
conversation in that purpose. My goal here is

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.620
not to learn signal processing. It is to

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.180
participate in the creation of brain computer interfaces.

00:31:12.015 --> 00:31:14.655
Chatbot tutors are not interested in what I'm

00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:16.975
trying to do. There's a set of things

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:19.535
they think I should know or should be

00:31:19.535 --> 00:31:21.295
able to do, and they view me as

00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:25.390
defective until I say the right things. If

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.230
I hire a real tutor, I might ask

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.590
them to sit beside me as I try

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.990
to actually do something involving the material. They

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.750
can see everything I'm doing, see what I'm

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.150
pointing at. And if it's appropriate, I can

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.910
scoot over and they can drive for a

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.075
minute. By comparison, the typical conception of a

00:31:40.075 --> 00:31:43.595
chatbot tutor lives in a windowless box, and

00:31:43.595 --> 00:31:45.595
it can only see whatever's provided on scraps

00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:47.995
of paper passed under the door. It can

00:31:47.995 --> 00:31:51.840
have no effect on the outside world. My

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.240
goal here is to dive in, to immerse

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.520
myself, to start doing the thing. But these

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.200
chatbot tutors can't join me where the action

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.800
is. So interactions with them create distance and

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.065
pull me away from immersion. If I hire

00:32:06.065 --> 00:32:09.985
a real tutor, we'll build a relationship. With

00:32:09.985 --> 00:32:12.065
every session, they'll learn more about me: my

00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:15.825
interests, my strengths, my confusions. Chatbot tutors, on

00:32:15.825 --> 00:32:18.865
the other hand, as typically conceived, are transactional,

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.380
amnesiac. Now, we can fix that as context

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.140
windows get longer. But that relationship is also

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.980
important to my emotional connection. If I view

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.005
conversation with my tutor as a kind of

00:32:32.005 --> 00:32:35.045
peripheral participation in the community I'm hoping to

00:32:35.045 --> 00:32:37.605
enter, an interaction between a novice in the

00:32:37.605 --> 00:32:40.725
discipline and an expert in the discipline, then

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.885
tutoring just becomes part of doing the thing.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.600
But if my interaction with the tutor is

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.080
transactional, that will tend to make my tutoring

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.000
sessions feel like learning time, separate from doing

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.760
the thing. Finally, people talk about how Aristotle

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.565
was a tutor for Alexander the Great. But

00:32:58.565 --> 00:33:01.045
what's most valuable about having Aristotle as your

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:04.325
tutor is not that he can diagnose misconceptions,

00:33:04.485 --> 00:33:06.725
but rather that he's modeling the practices and

00:33:06.725 --> 00:33:10.850
values of an earnest, intellectually engaged adult. He's

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.010
demonstrating how and why he thinks about problems

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.050
his taste and the discipline. The high growth

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.290
periods that we love transform the way that

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.490
we see the world. They reshape our identity.

00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:26.295
In my demo earlier, I showed a chatbot,

00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:28.135
but it didn't really work like most chatbot

00:33:28.135 --> 00:33:31.735
tutors I described. It focused all its actions

00:33:31.735 --> 00:33:34.375
on the user's interests rather than bringing its

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:36.615
own agenda. It wasn't trapped in a little

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.255
text box. It could see and take action

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.310
in the context of authentic use. It can

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.950
communicate through dynamic media. It had a deep

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.190
memory drawing on everything I'd ever seen and

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.070
written. So in some ways, the system I've

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.190
shown is more like a real tutor. But

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.030
in my ideal world, I don't want a

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.775
tutor. I want to legitimately participate in some

00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:01.015
new discipline and learn what I need as

00:34:01.015 --> 00:34:03.975
much as possible from interaction with real practitioners.

00:34:04.535 --> 00:34:06.615
So I view the role of the augmented

00:34:06.615 --> 00:34:09.760
learning system as helping me act on my

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.320
creative interests, ideally by letting me just dive

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.880
in and start doing as much as possible.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.080
That will often mean scaffolding connections to and

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.055
interactions with communities of practice. One theme for

00:34:23.055 --> 00:34:25.455
this Design at Large series is the ethics

00:34:25.455 --> 00:34:28.895
of AI and its likely enormous social impacts.

00:34:29.055 --> 00:34:30.735
So let me say, I am tremendously worried

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.975
about those impacts in the general case. I

00:34:32.975 --> 00:34:34.895
am worried about despots locking in their powers.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:39.550
Lowering the bar to bioweapons, economic chaos. I

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.750
would not feel comfortable ethically with researching more

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.390
powerful frontier models myself. But within the narrower

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.875
domain of learning that we've been discussing, my

00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:52.195
main moral concern is that we will end

00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:56.755
up trapped in a sad, narrow future. A

00:34:56.755 --> 00:35:00.435
condescending authoritarian frame dominates the narrative in the

00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:03.420
future of learning. I'll caricature it to make

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.700
the point. With AI, we can finally take

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.620
all of these defective kids that don't know

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.700
the stuff they're supposed to know and get

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.180
them to know it. You know, that's personalized

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.820
learning. The AI lets us precisely identify where

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.265
the kids are wrong or where they're ignorant

00:35:18.265 --> 00:35:20.745
and fix them. Then we can fill their

00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:22.185
heads to the brim with what's good for

00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:26.185
them. By contrast, the famous bicycle for the

00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:29.065
mind metaphor has no agenda other than the

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:31.480
one that you bring. It just lets you

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.320
reach a wider range of destinations than you

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.000
could on foot, and it makes the journey

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.320
more fun, maybe particularly if you're biking along

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.040
with some friends. The bicycle asks, Where do

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.240
you want to go? Of course, that question

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.535
assumes your destination is well known and charted

00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:50.055
on some map. But those most rewarding, high

00:35:50.055 --> 00:35:53.095
growth experiences are often centered on a creative

00:35:53.095 --> 00:35:55.335
project. You're trying to get somewhere no one's

00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:57.575
ever gone before to reach the frontier and

00:35:57.575 --> 00:36:01.350
then starting charting links into the unknown. Learning

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.190
in service of creation. It's a dynamic, context

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.470
laden kind of learning. It's about more than

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.910
just efficiency and correctness. More than just faster

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.725
gears on a bike. And that's the kind

00:36:14.725 --> 00:36:16.565
of learning that I feel an almost moral

00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:28.310
imperative to help create. Thank you. I think

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.310
we maybe have time for questions. We have

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:38.470
some time for questions. Love to talk. Thank

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.310
you. I really like a lot of what

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.985
you said. One thing that I'm curious about

00:36:41.985 --> 00:36:45.265
is you mentioned that you add questions to

00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:49.025
your own, like for your space repetition routine,

00:36:49.025 --> 00:36:50.785
you add questions every And you said you

00:36:50.785 --> 00:36:53.185
add 40 questions a day. So I guess

00:36:53.185 --> 00:36:55.750
what I'm wondering is, in your example you

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.230
took one topic, but many people are often

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.030
learning multiple things. And very often we don't

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.110
know that we want to learn something until

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.310
we've built some momentum. So my question is

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.230
broadly, how do you decide what questions you

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.485
want to add and how do you plan

00:37:11.485 --> 00:37:13.565
for your future self in some way? Right,

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:16.205
right. First, should clarify. So I don't, in

00:37:16.205 --> 00:37:18.925
fact, add 40 questions a day. That is

00:37:18.925 --> 00:37:22.765
the carrying capacity of my practice time. Ten

00:37:22.765 --> 00:37:25.490
minutes will support 40 a day added. In

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.250
practice, it ends up like some kind of

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.010
Poisson distribution or something. But how do I

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.170
do this? How do I plan appropriately? You

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.490
can't know what's going to be important to

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:38.610
you in advance. Sometimes you can, but in

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.455
general you can't. So the system needs to

00:37:41.455 --> 00:37:43.615
be resilient to that. The way that that

00:37:43.615 --> 00:37:46.735
works right now is very coarse. You can

00:37:46.735 --> 00:37:48.735
delete questions that you add if you decide

00:37:48.735 --> 00:37:51.055
that you don't like them. I view this

00:37:51.055 --> 00:37:52.815
as an interface problem of sorts. I think

00:37:52.815 --> 00:37:54.980
ideally you don't need to plan for what's

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.660
going to be important. You can just do

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.460
stuff, and stuff will get reinforced, and you

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.620
can steer more of this, less of that.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.100
And I think that's an interesting challenge in

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.260
interface design to create systems that behave more

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.095
like that and less like these kind of

00:38:10.095 --> 00:38:15.455
discrete destructive actions destroy this question. Andy, I

00:38:15.455 --> 00:38:19.135
love that vision over here for that. Especially

00:38:19.135 --> 00:38:21.615
liked how you talked about how the AI

00:38:21.615 --> 00:38:25.370
could reinforce things you've learned and challenge you.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.690
It could integrate you with communities. Love all

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.490
those ideas. What I didn't get, and maybe

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.570
I guess I walked in two minutes late,

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:36.490
was that an actual demo that you've created?

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.410
No. Or is that just a vision for

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.555
how you want it to be in the

00:38:39.555 --> 00:38:41.715
future? Yeah, I'm sorry for not making that

00:38:41.715 --> 00:38:43.315
clear. If it wasn't, I thought it looked

00:38:43.315 --> 00:38:47.555
sufficiently fake. No, this is concept art. Thank

00:38:47.555 --> 00:38:50.275
you for asking. There is, I suppose, a

00:38:50.275 --> 00:38:52.595
grand tradition in our discipline of smoke and

00:38:52.595 --> 00:38:56.420
mirror concept art. I have been using this

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.420
talk as an excuse to figure out what

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.020
I think I want to do with respect

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.220
to AI and learning. And so these drawings

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:11.335
are part of that process. I was curious,

00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:14.135
I wanted to follow-up on the question about

00:39:15.255 --> 00:39:17.415
sometimes I don't know what I want. And

00:39:17.415 --> 00:39:19.095
I think if you look at some of

00:39:19.095 --> 00:39:24.570
the more Montessori or Papert esque learning experiences,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.570
when you know when you have like, you

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.850
know, if you just said school is gonna

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.570
be whatever you're interested in forever. Yeah. It

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:38.025
has lots of benefits. A challenge is that

00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:41.385
there are topics that I might benefit from,

00:39:41.385 --> 00:39:44.585
and I loved your paternalistic caricature as being

00:39:44.585 --> 00:39:46.825
that's what we don't want. There is a,

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.390
like, the psychologist Dan Gilbert defines the happiness

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.830
challenge as the delta between our current self

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.990
and what our future self would have wanted

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.270
us to do. I can, like a nice

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.135
thing about a good tutor, your talk for

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:06.695
example, is I'm learning things that will be

00:40:06.695 --> 00:40:08.855
valuable to me in the future that at

00:40:08.855 --> 00:40:11.495
04:00 today I wouldn't have thought to ask

00:40:11.495 --> 00:40:14.375
for. Right. Yeah, yeah, I think this is

00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:16.190
totally right. I think the way that I

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.030
think about this is a kind of unbundling.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.110
Normally when we think about schooling, we ask

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.430
schooling to do two jobs: one, to decide

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.790
what is it that I should know and

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.390
then two, to cause me to know it.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.270
I think there are all kinds of cultural

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.335
institutions that help us figure out what is

00:40:30.335 --> 00:40:32.735
it that we want to know. In the

00:40:32.735 --> 00:40:34.655
example that I showed, Sam figures out that

00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:36.655
they may be interested in brain computer interfaces

00:40:36.655 --> 00:40:40.095
through Twitter. If you are in San Diego,

00:40:40.095 --> 00:40:42.770
you can decide to attend this talk. Ideally,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.130
it doesn't feel like schooling. Hope it doesn't

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.730
feel like schooling. And you can decide, oh,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.410
maybe I'm interested in studying some of the

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.890
cognitive science that Andy mentioned. So I think

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.410
there's a variety of cultural institutions and venues

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.810
and channels we can use to help deliver

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:01.175
that first part, and then possibly use separate

00:41:01.175 --> 00:41:07.335
tools for the other part. Good afternoon. Should

00:41:07.335 --> 00:41:09.575
we be planning for the day where we

00:41:09.575 --> 00:41:12.775
won't have to work due to artificial intelligence,

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:18.030
automation, computers and robotics? Your thoughts. Thank you.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.110
I'm so grateful that you asked that question

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.790
because I spent a month preparing for this

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:25.950
talk, writing another version of this talk that

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.825
I didn't give that was called What's Worth

00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:30.865
Learning in the Age of Strong AI? And

00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:32.705
it didn't end up aligning, so I didn't

00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:34.385
end up getting to present any of it.

00:41:35.105 --> 00:41:39.940
I'll give you a piece of that. Say

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.900
that you are a composer, and you have

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.140
some very vague idea about a new cello

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.100
concerto that you would like to write. I

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.180
claim that you can't just ask the AI

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.475
to write it for you, because you don't

00:41:54.475 --> 00:41:57.275
know what it is that you want. In

00:41:57.275 --> 00:41:58.955
fact, you discover what the cello concerto is

00:41:58.955 --> 00:42:00.795
supposed to be through the process of composing

00:42:00.795 --> 00:42:05.835
it. Likewise, when we talk about software. An

00:42:05.835 --> 00:42:08.620
interesting thing about software is that it feels

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.300
so messy and unpleasant so much of the

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.380
time. We want a particular piece of software.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.980
We ask some people to go start making

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.900
it for us. And then they come back

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.180
3x over time, 3x over budget, one third

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.420
x quality. Why is software so hard? Why

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.035
can't we just tell the system what we

00:42:24.035 --> 00:42:26.995
want and get the thing out the other

00:42:26.995 --> 00:42:29.235
side? And it turns out we actually do

00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:31.875
have that kind of technology. It's called formal

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.635
modeling. We've had it for a long time.

00:42:33.955 --> 00:42:35.235
And I think the reason why it's not

00:42:35.235 --> 00:42:37.210
more widely used is that that's not how

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.570
we think about designing software. Namely, we figure

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.490
out what software we want in the process

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:47.210
of making it. It's continuously negotiated. It's contingent.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.530
So I think there are many activities in

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.915
human life that have that characteristic where we

00:42:51.915 --> 00:42:54.395
can't actually appropriately specify what it is that

00:42:54.395 --> 00:42:55.995
we want to the model. We can't externalize

00:42:55.995 --> 00:42:57.595
it or make it legible. We have to

00:42:57.595 --> 00:43:00.475
participate in the creation of the thing. And

00:43:00.475 --> 00:43:01.595
then we can ask, what do we need

00:43:01.595 --> 00:43:03.355
to know in order to participate in that

00:43:03.355 --> 00:43:05.355
creation? What are the dynamics of that participation?

00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:08.440
How much injection of involvement is necessary to

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.120
steer appropriately. And I have some thoughts on

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.720
that, but I should probably move on to

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.040
the next question. So yes, I hope that's

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:23.065
somewhat helpful. Yeah. Hi. So with my question,

00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:25.545
I was thinking about how with the AI,

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:27.465
what you have is you like say that

00:43:27.465 --> 00:43:30.105
AI advancement will lead to some dystopian feature

00:43:30.105 --> 00:43:31.705
where we find people the knowledge and then

00:43:31.705 --> 00:43:33.980
we force them to know it. But who's

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.420
to say that that is still already happening

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.340
to some extent with curriculum right now without

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.260
AI? Isn't necessarily a concern as much as

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.260
other things, I think. But beyond that, I

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.900
think it's kind of like, because that problem

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.635
can happen, like when we don't look at

00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:49.715
the root problem, it can happen in the

00:43:49.715 --> 00:43:52.755
most immersive learning. In ethnic studies class you

00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:54.835
can still end up restricting someone to that

00:43:54.835 --> 00:43:57.395
specific topic instead of connecting identity as much

00:43:57.395 --> 00:43:58.755
as you would in say a math class

00:43:58.755 --> 00:44:01.100
or something like that. So what if you

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.860
could implement that like sort of, I guess

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.020
to give another example of how in the

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.180
other hand, you can do something really well,

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.260
even in a math class, for example, if

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.860
you look at the higher concepts or if

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.705
someone explains it really well, or in like

00:44:14.705 --> 00:44:17.105
say neuroscience and those sorts of fields, there

00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:18.945
might be content that is above the cost

00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:21.105
that is interesting that would make someone more

00:44:21.105 --> 00:44:23.505
interested and able to learn the class themselves,

00:44:23.665 --> 00:44:25.505
especially if it connects to their own prior

00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:27.890
knowledge. So what would you think if like,

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.930
guess, how do you think you would implement

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.090
this into like a learning system to take

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:34.930
advantage of it like say Canvas? Do you

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.050
think that you could do it in a

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.690
way that you could customize in part assignments

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.570
to synthesize the students' interests and the teachers'

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.655
intent to teach people necessary content and teach

00:44:44.655 --> 00:44:46.735
people the content that they want to know

00:44:46.735 --> 00:44:48.415
in a way that they might be doing

00:44:48.415 --> 00:44:50.815
more, but ultimately less because it's easier for

00:44:50.815 --> 00:44:52.655
them if they know the context and can

00:44:52.655 --> 00:44:56.220
connect to it. Cool. I think I followed.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.700
So to your first question, yeah, I think

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.580
you're right. That part of the talk was

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.060
part of a complaint about schooling in general.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.545
And AI doesn't necessarily make that worse, though

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:16.985
it may continue trends I don't like. To

00:45:17.065 --> 00:45:20.585
your second point, or your second question, I

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:24.585
have deliberately avoided the question of schooling in

00:45:24.585 --> 00:45:28.240
this talk. And I did that for a

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.640
reason. I think it makes everything very complicated.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.600
So in terms of integrating into Canvas, I

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.040
think it's a very difficult position to start.

00:45:40.355 --> 00:45:43.475
I have done a bunch of collaborations these

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:47.555
past few years with professors in higher ed

00:45:48.035 --> 00:45:52.275
teaching large classes. And what I experience again

00:45:52.275 --> 00:45:56.200
and again is just an enormous fraction of

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.920
the student body that is just fundamentally not

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.800
engaged with the class. And I don't think

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.360
any amount of UI chicanery or AI involvement

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.645
is going to change that. And I think

00:46:09.645 --> 00:46:11.565
I basically don't want to put myself into

00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:13.885
that problem solving situation. In some sense, that's

00:46:13.885 --> 00:46:18.445
actually why I left Khan Academy. Hey, Andy.

00:46:18.445 --> 00:46:20.685
My name's Taylor. I'm a software engineer at

00:46:20.685 --> 00:46:23.480
Replit. So I would say, in some sense,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.480
my salary depends on some of the ideas

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.240
in your talk, which is to say that

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.320
AI can be an effective tool for teaching

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.240
difficult concepts like computer programming. So my question

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.680
to you is, have you seen any inklings

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.865
of this being true, the ideas in your

00:46:39.865 --> 00:46:43.225
talk of the delta between something like a

00:46:43.225 --> 00:46:47.065
GBT, being a teacher, and what you're outlining?

00:46:47.145 --> 00:46:50.425
Have you seen any of those ideas actually

00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:52.020
start to play out? Or do you think

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.860
this is purely speculative with what we have

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.820
today? Yeah. I think we're seeing a lot

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.340
of hints at what I described already. So

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.735
lots of people already use GPT to just

00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:09.975
dive into stuff. It's missing that universal IO.

00:47:09.975 --> 00:47:13.655
It's missing the billion token context window. And

00:47:13.655 --> 00:47:16.055
yet it's still already able to deliver some

00:47:16.455 --> 00:47:20.220
value, which is great. I think missing also

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.140
that the bridge to textbooks again and again,

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.140
I've been talking to people not that textbooks

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.820
are the answer. Here I'm using textbook as

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.540
synecdoche for some kind of deeper, more focused

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.745
learning experience. I talk to a lot of

00:47:33.745 --> 00:47:37.425
people who get a really good start with

00:47:37.425 --> 00:47:40.065
GPT because they can get the couple sentence

00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:41.825
answers, and that lets them make a certain

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.665
amount of progress. And that's really motivating. You

00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.505
can kick up some momentum, and momentum is

00:47:45.505 --> 00:47:49.080
very powerful. But they hit a wall. And

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.480
I had a section that I cut talking

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.960
about programming. I think it's really interesting that

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.360
in programming, a lot of people can manage

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.480
to self teach programming. And in part, I

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.435
think that's because of things like syntax, for

00:48:02.435 --> 00:48:04.755
instance, is reinforced every time you sit down

00:48:04.755 --> 00:48:08.515
to program. Obscure facets of syntax, which are

00:48:08.515 --> 00:48:11.475
not reinforced regularly, like maybe your macro library

00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:15.635
or whatever, people do tend to forget. But

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.990
again and again you meet people who are

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:22.510
like, I don't understand how pointers work though.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.670
That asterisk can see. It's like it's a

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.590
bridge too far. So there's a certain amount

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.870
of conceptual understanding that seems acquirable with the

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.270
frontier of self learning tools that are widely

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.635
available. And then as soon as you run

00:48:34.635 --> 00:48:37.675
into difficult conceptual territory, it's just a cliff.

00:48:37.675 --> 00:48:41.275
So I think we're seeing glimmers of progress

00:48:41.355 --> 00:48:44.235
in this vein, and perhaps this talk will

00:48:44.235 --> 00:48:49.880
inspire people to try some more stuff. Hello.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.160
Hi. So my question is, to what extent

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.760
do you think the desire to learn comes

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.800
from the innate pleasure of learning or specific

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.005
to whatever material the person learning is? And

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:04.085
to what extent do you think the desire

00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:06.885
to learn comes from some sort of use

00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:08.965
of the material the person learns? And do

00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:14.005
you think making this distinction is important to

00:49:14.005 --> 00:49:17.770
the design of systems for learning? Yeah, probably.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.730
This is a good question, and it's something

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.930
that I don't emphasize perhaps quite clearly enough.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.170
In the example story that I gave, everything

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.715
is motivated by this persona, Sam, wanting to

00:49:31.715 --> 00:49:33.715
do a project. It's very concrete. It's out

00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:38.275
in the world. That doesn't mean that curiosity

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:41.315
based learning is any less legitimate or that

00:49:41.315 --> 00:49:43.075
I think any of the claims don't apply.

00:49:43.075 --> 00:49:46.010
It's just that what authentic practice and legitimate

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.850
participation looks like is different. So in mathematics,

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.450
for instance, which may be very abstract, it

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.050
may not be like a project I'm trying

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.970
to do as I learn about algebraic topology

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.225
or something like that, What legitimate practice looks

00:49:58.225 --> 00:50:01.905
like is engaging with problems and questions in

00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:07.825
algebraic topology that I find authentically interesting. And

00:50:07.825 --> 00:50:09.505
as soon as you make that move, rather

00:50:09.505 --> 00:50:10.865
than thinking about, well, I need to learn

00:50:10.865 --> 00:50:12.920
algebraic topology in order to do this four

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.520
d renderer that I was working on for

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.760
a game project, if you think about it

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.160
from the perspective of authentic curiosity, then I

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.920
think much of what I'm saying applies. However,

00:50:24.365 --> 00:50:28.445
there are issues with rendering legible the nature

00:50:28.445 --> 00:50:30.445
of the curiosity and the interest to the

00:50:30.445 --> 00:50:33.805
AI. A lot of what's happening is internal,

00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.405
and that may make a lot of what

00:50:35.405 --> 00:50:40.240
I'm describing somewhat more difficult. The nature of

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.120
relation to community of practices changes somewhat, although

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.280
not completely. So it's a partial answer, I

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.920
suppose. Is there someone with the microphone? Hi,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.485
Jonathan. Hi, Andy. This is great. Love the

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:58.325
deepness of the reflective practice you're demonstrating for

00:50:58.325 --> 00:51:02.485
us I think, is it Aristotle that said,

00:51:02.645 --> 00:51:04.405
give me a child till the age of

00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.980
seven and I'll show you the man? And

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.780
when you bring up the ethical issues, this

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.660
is what scares me the most is for

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:20.695
an AI tutor. Have you thought about adversarial

00:51:20.695 --> 00:51:24.695
tutoring? Given that we're going to have, if

00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:27.335
we do, if we hypothesize AI tutors are

00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:29.255
out there and that we have the schooling

00:51:29.255 --> 00:51:34.050
industrial complex producing them, how do we counteract

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.770
them? I love that. It's like manufacturing the

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.970
mythical and often in the teaching community maligned

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:47.090
Robin Williams character, the teacher film whose name

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.875
I'm forgetting. I haven't thought about that. It's

00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:57.035
a lovely provocation. I feel uncomfortable with an

00:51:57.755 --> 00:52:00.155
activist framing, where it's like, I need to

00:52:00.155 --> 00:52:02.315
get out there because I know what's best

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.720
for the people or for the kids. They're

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.160
doing it wrong. I'm going make a thing

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.560
that's going to put fluoride in the drinking

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.200
water so that they end up in the

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:17.385
right spot. I'm uncomfortable with that. I feel

00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:19.465
much more comfortable saying, well, I can make

00:52:19.465 --> 00:52:20.585
a thing that lets you pursue the things

00:52:20.585 --> 00:52:22.265
you're interested in, if you would like that.

00:52:22.745 --> 00:52:26.905
That feels less complicated. So I will need

00:52:26.905 --> 00:52:28.665
to think about your question. Find it very

00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:35.820
provocative. Thank you. Hey, Andy. I have a

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.020
question for you about this idea of that

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.500
AI tutor. I'm wondering, is there a limit

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.755
to what kind of disciplines that that course

00:52:46.755 --> 00:52:49.315
kind of technology could be applied to? I've

00:52:49.315 --> 00:52:52.515
always deemed myself as being book smarts but

00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:57.155
not street smarts. That's a great question. One

00:52:57.155 --> 00:53:00.470
of the inspirations for this talk was trying

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.630
to exorcise myself of the young ladies illustrated

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.310
primer. I don't know if that phrase means

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.950
anything to you. Ah, that's a shame. Okay,

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.855
so an inspiration for many educational technologists is

00:53:12.855 --> 00:53:14.295
this book called The Diamond Age by Neal

00:53:14.295 --> 00:53:17.575
Stephenson, which depicts a sort of far future

00:53:17.575 --> 00:53:21.335
utopian learning environment. It's like a magical book

00:53:22.935 --> 00:53:25.870
that transforms a young girl's life. And one

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.550
of the things that's interesting about this book

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:29.150
that I think is underappreciated is that it

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:31.550
is almost exclusively focused on street smarts. So

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.270
this book teaches her martial arts and getting

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.590
out of sticky situations and persuading people and

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.965
so on. And I chose not to deal

00:53:40.965 --> 00:53:45.205
with any of that. I think the way

00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:49.045
that I would handle much of that looks

00:53:49.045 --> 00:53:53.000
very different. And I'm afraid I haven't really

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.480
thought about how I would handle that. It's

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.000
difficult to think about authentic practice of street

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.360
smarts. Like what does that look like? Is

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.675
it like I'm going to go to a

00:54:06.835 --> 00:54:09.075
bad neighborhood and like look purposeful as I

00:54:09.075 --> 00:54:12.355
walk? And then but that's not exactly authentic

00:54:12.355 --> 00:54:14.035
practice because like you went to this neighborhood

00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:16.835
just for that purpose. So I find myself

00:54:16.835 --> 00:54:21.590
confused thinking about this. And I find myself

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.670
most comfortable when I think about people who

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.430
enjoy practicing martial arts not as a kind

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:35.435
of preparatory measure for imagined conflict in the

00:54:35.435 --> 00:54:37.355
future, but rather because they like the way

00:54:37.355 --> 00:54:39.035
it makes their body feel. They like their

00:54:39.035 --> 00:54:42.955
community at the dojo. And so if we

00:54:42.955 --> 00:54:45.890
start thinking about that, like, oh, it would

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:47.890
be fun to do some exercise with others,

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.610
then I think some of the same techniques

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:53.490
can help. So you can probably use tools

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.050
to help you find an appropriate community and

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.530
perhaps to help you practice appropriately. I play

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.775
the piano. And that's not exactly book smart,

00:55:01.775 --> 00:55:05.375
but one can use practice systems, vessels for

00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:08.655
practice like I've described, to orchestrate piano practice.

00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:11.615
You can imagine extending that to martial arts.

00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:12.815
I don't know about other kinds of street

00:55:12.815 --> 00:55:16.780
smarts, but perhaps. Thanks for the question. Let's

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.540
thank Andy, and I'm sure he'll stay around

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:23.980
a few little. Thanks everybody. Appreciate you.
