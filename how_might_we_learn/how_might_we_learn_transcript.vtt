00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.640
Talks about learning technology often center on technology.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.280
So instead, I'd like to begin by asking:

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.840
What do you want learning to be like

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:15.545
for yourself? If you could just snap your

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:19.465
fingers and have the ideal perfect learning environment,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.865
what would that be like? One way to

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.265
start getting at this question is to ask,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.910
what were the most rewarding high growth periods

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.910
of your life? I've noticed two patterns when

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.605
I ask people this question. First, people will

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.205
tell me about a period in their life

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:44.565
where they learned a ton, but where learning

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:48.085
wasn't the point. Instead, they were totally immersed

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:49.845
in some project with a great deal of

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:52.885
personal meaning, like a scrappy startup or a

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:56.260
research project or an artistic urge or just

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.420
a fiery curiosity. And a lot of learning

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.820
happened just along the way. They learned whatever

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.740
they needed. They dove in. They got their

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.915
hands dirty. Secondly, in these stories, learning really

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:15.675
worked. People emerged feeling transformed, newly capable, filled

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.915
with insights that remained with them years later.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.650
These stories are so vivid in part because

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.210
learning rarely feels this way. People are often

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.210
telling me somewhat wistfully about an experience that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.170
occurred years or decades earlier. Learning rarely feels

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.265
so subordinated to an authentic pursuit. Often if

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.345
we try to just dive in, we dive

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:38.425
into a brick wall, or we find ourselves

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.465
uneasily cargo culting others without any real understanding

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:44.745
of what's actually going on. So why can't

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:48.080
we just dive in all the time? Instead,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.600
it often feels like we have to put

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.680
our aims on hold while we go do

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.840
some homework and learn properly. And worse, learning

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.280
so often just doesn't really work. We take

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.095
the class, we read the book, And then

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:03.295
when we try to put that knowledge into

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.575
practice, we find that it's fragile. It doesn't

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.335
transfer well. Worse, we'll often find that we've

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:11.695
forgotten half of it by the time we

00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:14.255
try to use it. Why does learning so

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:19.080
often fail to actually work? These questions connect

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080
to an age old conflict among educators and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.280
learning scientists between implicit learning, also known as

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.040
discovery learning, inquiry learning, situated learning, and guided

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.760
learning, which is often represented by cognitive scientists

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.600
of the kind we find here at UCSD.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.855
Advocates of implicit learning methods argue that we

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:40.175
should prioritize discovery, motivation, authentic involvement, and being

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.135
situated in a community of practice. In the

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:46.175
opposing camp, cognitive psychologists argue that you really

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:47.855
do need to pay attention to the architecture

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.360
of cognition, to long term memory, to procedural

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.800
fluency, and to scaffold appropriately for cognitive load.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.640
In my view, each of these of view

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.195
contains a lot of truth. And they also

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:07.195
ignore each other to their detriment. Implicit learning

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:10.875
aptly recognizes meaning and emotion but ignores the

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.515
often decisive constraints of cognition what we need

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:17.290
to actually make learning work. Guided learning advocates

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.930
are focused on making learning work, and they

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.450
sometimes succeed, but usually by sacrificing that purposeful

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.690
sense of immersion that we love about those

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.835
rewarding high growth periods. One obvious approach is

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.715
to try compromise. Project based learning is a

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:35.435
good representation of that. By creating a scaffolded

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:37.595
series of projects, the suggestion is that we

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.275
can get some of the benefits of implicit

00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:44.620
learning authenticity, motivation, transferability while also getting the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.500
instructional control and the cognitive awareness that might

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.860
be typical of traditional courses. The trouble is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.620
that usually we get the worst of both

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.915
worlds. I remember when I was in college,

00:03:57.915 --> 00:03:59.755
I was interested in three d game programming,

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:01.275
so I signed up for a project based

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.635
course on computer graphics. The trouble was that

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:07.675
those projects weren't my projects. So a few

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:10.260
weeks in, I ended up implementing array marching

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.060
for more efficient bump mapping. And unfortunately, I

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.220
was really just implementing some math that I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.660
was handed because this course was trying to

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.500
take project based learning seriously. So there weren't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700
long textbook readings, weren't long problem sets. But

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.295
I didn't understand the math. What I ended

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:25.575
up with was a project that I didn't

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:29.895
care about implementing something I didn't understand. Instead,

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:32.775
I suggest, we should take both views seriously.

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.815
Find a way to synthesize the two. You

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:39.415
really do want to make doing the thing

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.040
the primary activity. But the realities of cognitive

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.760
psychology mean that in many cases, you really

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.280
do need explicit guidance, scaffolding, practice, intention and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.535
memory support. Learning by immersion works naturalistically when

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:54.375
the material has a low enough complexity relative

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.295
to your prior knowledge that you can successfully

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.455
process it on the fly and when natural

00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:03.495
participation routinely reinforces everything important, giving you fluency.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:06.130
When those conditions aren't satisfied, which is most

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.050
of the time, you will need some support.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.690
You want to just dive in. And you

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.810
want learning to actually work. To make that

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.970
happen, we need to infuse your authentic projects

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.355
with guided support, where necessary, inspired by the

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.755
best ideas from cognitive science. And if there's

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:25.355
something that requires more focused, explicit learning, then

00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:27.595
you want those experiences to be utterly in

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:32.220
service to your actual aims. Now I've been

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.140
thinking about this synthesis for many years, and

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.140
honestly, I've mostly been pretty stuck. Recently though,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.180
I've been thinking a lot about AI, which

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.565
I know gets an eye roll. Certainly every

00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:47.605
mention of AI in education gets an eye

00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:50.645
roll from me. But I confess, the possibility

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:53.445
of AI has helped me finally get what

00:05:53.445 --> 00:05:56.325
feels like some traction on this particular problem.

00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:58.325
So I'd like to share some of those

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:02.020
early concepts today. We'll explore this possible synthesis

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.700
through a story in six parts. Meet Sam.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.980
Sam studied computer science in university, and they're

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.580
now working as a software engineer at a

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.215
big tech company. But Sam is bored at

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:18.255
their day job. Not everything is boring, though.

00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:20.335
Every time Sam sees a tweet announcing new

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:23.215
results in brain computer interfaces, they're absolutely captivated.

00:06:23.535 --> 00:06:25.615
These projects seem so much more interesting than

00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:28.210
what they're doing by day. Sam pulls up

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.010
the papers looking for some way to contribute,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.850
but they hit a brick wall with so

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.850
many unfamiliar topics all at once. What if

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.250
Sam could ask for help finding some meaningful

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.855
way to start participating? With Sam's permission, our

00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:46.495
AI, and let's assume it's a local AI,

00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:48.335
can build up a huge amount of context

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:51.375
about their background. From old documents on Sam's

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:53.455
hard drive, our AI knows all about their

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.000
university coursework. It can see their current skills

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.560
through work projects. It knows something about Sam's

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.240
interests through their browsing history. So it suggests

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.400
a few ideas, and Sam is excited about

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.880
the idea of reproducing the paper's data analysis.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.165
That seems to play to their strengths. They

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:12.965
notice that the authors use a custom Python

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.045
package to do their analysis, but that code

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:17.685
was never published. And that seems intriguing. Sam

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:20.645
has built open source tools before. Maybe they

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.565
could contribute here by building an open source

00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:26.270
version of this signal processing pipeline. So Sam

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.110
dives in. They've found an open access dataset,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.510
and they've taken the first steps to start

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.190
working with it. Tools like Copilot help Sam

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.190
get started. But to follow some of these

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.345
signal processing steps, what Sam really needs here

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:44.105
is something like Copilot, but with awareness of

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:46.505
the paper in addition to the code and

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.505
with context about what Sam's actually trying to

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:53.145
do. This AI system isn't trapped in its

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:55.350
own chat box or in the sidebar of

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.750
one application. It can see what's going on

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.030
across multiple applications, and it can propose actions

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.190
across multiple applications. Sam can click that button

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.750
to view a change set with the potential

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.185
implementation. Here that is. And then they can

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:14.545
continue the conversation, smoothly switching into the context

00:08:14.545 --> 00:08:17.345
of the code editor. Like, what is this

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:21.985
axis equals one parameter? The explanation depends on

00:08:21.985 --> 00:08:24.910
context from the code editor, from the paper

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.710
being implemented, and also the documentation that came

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.510
with the data set Sam's working with. The

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.350
AI underlines assumptions made based on specific information

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.815
and turns those things into links. So Sam

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:40.615
can click on that in this dataset link,

00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:42.935
and our AI opens the ReadMe to the

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:46.455
relevant line. All this is to support our

00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:49.175
central aim, which is that Sam can immerse

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:52.470
themselves as much as possible in what they're

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.430
actually trying to do, but get the support

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.270
they need to understand what they're doing. And

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.190
that support doesn't have to just mean text.

00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:06.085
Sam next needs to implement a downsampling stage.

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:10.165
And this time, guidance includes synthesized dynamic media

00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:12.885
so that Sam can understand what downsampling does

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:16.760
through scaffolded immersion. Doesn't need to read an

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.160
abstract explanation and try to imagine what that

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.480
would do to different signals. Instead, as they

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.800
try different sampling rates, real time feedback can

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.040
help them internalize the effect on different signals.

00:09:28.645 --> 00:09:30.485
By playing with the dynamic media, Sam notices

00:09:30.485 --> 00:09:32.005
that some of the peaks are lost when

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:36.565
the signal is downsampled. These dynamic media aren't

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:39.445
trapped in the chat box. They're using the

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:42.165
same input data and libraries that Sam is

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.480
using in their notebook. So at any time,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.880
Sam can just view source to tinker with

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880
this figure or to use some of its

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.840
code in their own notebook. Now Sam presses

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.925
on. But as they dig into bandpass filters,

00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:03.325
the high level explanations they can get from

00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:06.445
these short chat interactions really just don't feel

00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:10.285
like enough. What is a frequency domain? What

00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:13.070
is a Nyquist rate? Sam can copy and

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.390
paste some AI generated code all day, but

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.790
they don't understand what's going on at all.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.750
A chat interface is just not a great

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.910
medium for long form conceptual explanation. It's time

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.445
here for something deeper. Now, our AI knows

00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:32.245
Sam's background and aims here, so it suggests

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:35.285
an appropriate undergraduate text with a practical focus.

00:10:36.245 --> 00:10:39.250
And more importantly, the AI reassures Sam that

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.810
they don't necessarily need to read this entire

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.730
thousand page book right now. It focuses on

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.290
Sam's goal here and suggests a range of

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.090
accessible paths that Sam can choose according to

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.930
how deeply they would like to understand this

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.455
material. The AI has made a personal map

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.935
in the book's table of contents so that

00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:01.495
if Sam, for instance, just wants to understand

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:04.375
what these filters are doing and why, there's

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:06.695
a 25 page path for that. But if

00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:08.695
they want to know the mathematical background how

00:11:08.695 --> 00:11:11.280
these filters work, there's a deeper path. And

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.560
if they want to actually be able to

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.000
implement them themselves, there's an even deeper path.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.840
You can choose a journey here. When Sam

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.920
digs into the book, you'll find notes from

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.680
the AI at the start of each section

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.335
and scattered throughout, which ground the material in

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:30.495
Sam's context, Sam's project, Sam's purpose. This section

00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:31.855
will help you understand how to think about

00:11:31.855 --> 00:11:34.415
signals in terms of frequency spectra. That's what

00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:38.440
low pass filters manipulate. Sam is spending some

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.200
time away from their project in a more

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.640
traditionally instructional setting. But that doesn't mean the

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.880
experience has to lose its connection to their

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.920
authentic purpose. Incidentally, I've heard some technologists suggest

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.600
that we should just use AI to synthesize

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.985
the whole book. We'll get per person bespoke

00:11:55.985 --> 00:11:58.705
textbooks. But I think that there's actually a

00:11:58.705 --> 00:12:01.265
huge amount of value in having shared canonical

00:12:01.265 --> 00:12:03.505
artifacts. In any given field, there are key

00:12:03.505 --> 00:12:05.345
texts that we can all point to, and

00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:07.265
they form a common ground for the culture.

00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:09.860
I think we can preserve that by layering

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.180
personalized context on top as a lens like

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.420
this. In my ideal future, of course, our

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.940
canonical shared artifacts are dynamic media, not digital

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.115
representations of dead trees. But until all of

00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:25.995
our canonical works are rewritten as a transitional

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.075
measure, we can at least wave our hands

00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:30.555
and imagine that our AI could synthesize dynamic

00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:34.235
media versions of figures like this one. Now,

00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:35.940
as Sam reads through the book, they can

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.620
continue to engage with the text by asking

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.580
questions as before, and our AI's responses will

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.180
continue to be grounded in their project. As

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.740
Sam highlights the text or makes comments about

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.845
details which seem particularly important or surprising, those

00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:52.805
annotations won't end up trapped inside the PDF.

00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:55.285
Instead, they will feed into future discussions and

00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:59.045
practice, as we'll see later. In addition to

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:01.925
Sam asking questions of the AI, the AI

00:13:01.925 --> 00:13:04.900
can insert questions for Sam to consider, again

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.860
grounded in their project, to promote deeper processing

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.700
of the material. And just as our AI

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.700
guided Sam to the right sections of this

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.260
thousand page book, it can point out which

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.140
exercises might be most valuable, considering both Sam's

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.835
background and their aims. Better, it can connect

00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:27.675
the exercises to Sam's aims so that aspirationally,

00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:31.035
doing those problems feels continuous with Sam's authentic

00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:34.635
practice. Even if the exercises do still feel

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:38.210
somewhat decontextualized, Sam can at least feel more

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.890
confident that the work is going to help

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.890
them do what they want to do. So

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.210
Sam ends the day with some rewarding progress

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.930
on their project and a newfound understanding of

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.015
quite a few topics. But this isn't yet

00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:56.095
robust knowledge. SAM has very little fluency. If

00:13:56.095 --> 00:13:58.255
they try to use this material seriously, they'll

00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:00.735
probably feel like they're standing on shaky ground.

00:14:01.455 --> 00:14:05.300
And more prosaically, they will probably forget much

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.580
of what they just learned. So I'd like

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.180
to focus on memory for a bit here.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.180
It's worth asking, why do we sometimes remember

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.115
conceptual material and sometimes not? Often we take

00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:20.515
a class or read a book or even

00:14:20.515 --> 00:14:22.915
just look something up and find that a

00:14:22.915 --> 00:14:26.595
short time later, have retained almost nothing. But

00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:29.075
sometimes things seem to stick. Why is that?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.350
There are some easier cases. If you're learning

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.790
something new in a domain that you know

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.110
well, each new fact connects to lots of

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.910
prior knowledge, and that creates more cues for

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.785
recall and more opportunities for reinforcement. Likewise, if

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:45.625
you're in some setting where you need that

00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:47.865
knowledge every single day, you will find that

00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:51.545
your memory becomes reliable pretty quickly. Conceptual material

00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:54.105
like what Sam just learned doesn't usually get

00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:57.960
reinforced every day like that. But sometimes the

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.000
world conspires to give those memories the reinforcement

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.920
it needs. Sometimes you read about a topic,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.480
and then later in that evening, that topic

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.095
comes up in conversation with the collaborator. You

00:15:11.095 --> 00:15:12.855
have to retrieve what you learned, and that

00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:16.215
retrieval reinforces the memory. Then, maybe two days

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.535
later, it comes up again. You need to

00:15:18.535 --> 00:15:21.575
recall that knowledge for a project. Each time

00:15:21.575 --> 00:15:23.735
you reinforce the memory this way, you forget

00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:26.370
it more slowly. Now perhaps a week can

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.530
go by and you're still likely to remember,

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.770
then maybe a few weeks, then a few

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.530
months, and so on. With a surprisingly small

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.170
number of retrievals, if they're placed close enough

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.985
to avoid forgetting, you can retain that knowledge

00:15:39.985 --> 00:15:43.825
for months or years. By contrast, sometimes when

00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:45.905
you learn something, it doesn't come up again

00:15:45.905 --> 00:15:48.385
until, say, the next week. Then you try

00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:50.305
to retrieve the knowledge, but maybe it's already

00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:52.385
been forgotten. So you have to look it

00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:55.030
up. Looking it up doesn't reinforce your memory

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.750
very much. And then if it doesn't come

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.750
up again for a while longer, you may

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.750
still not remember the next time. So you

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.750
have to look it up again. And so

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.270
on. The key insight here is that it's

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.695
possible to arrange the timeline for yourself. And

00:16:11.695 --> 00:16:15.455
of course, courses sometimes do when each problem

00:16:15.455 --> 00:16:18.095
set consistently interleaves knowledge from the prior problem

00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:22.575
sets. But immersive learning and for that matter,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.160
most learning usually doesn't arrange this properly, so

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.920
you usually forget a lot. What if this

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.560
kind of reinforcement were woven into the grain

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.565
of the learning region? Collaborator Michael Nielsen and

00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:40.685
I created a quantum computing primer, Quantum Country,

00:16:40.765 --> 00:16:44.525
to explore this idea. It's available for free

00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:47.165
online. If you head to quantum.country, you'll see

00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:48.605
what looks at first like a normal book.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.770
And after a few minutes of reading, the

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.410
text is interrupted with a small set of

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.410
review questions. They're designed to take just a

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.965
few seconds each. Think the answer to yourself.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.885
Then mark whether or not you were able

00:17:06.885 --> 00:17:10.245
to answer correctly. And so far, these look

00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:13.925
like simple flashcards. But as we've discussed, even

00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:15.765
if you can answer these questions now, that

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:17.285
doesn't mean you'll be able to in a

00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:19.730
few weeks or even in a few days.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.930
So notice these markings at the bottom of

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.850
each question. These represent intervals. So you practice

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.090
the questions while you're reading the text. Then

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.930
one week later, you'll get an email that

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.170
says, Hey, you have probably started to forget

00:17:33.435 --> 00:17:35.515
some of what you've learned. Do you want

00:17:35.515 --> 00:17:37.355
to take five minutes to quickly review that

00:17:37.355 --> 00:17:40.715
material again? Each time you answer successfully, the

00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:43.195
interval increases to a few weeks and a

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.595
few months and so on. If you begin

00:17:45.595 --> 00:17:48.600
to forget, then the intervals tighten up to

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.160
provide more reinforcement. Now you may have seen

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.800
systems like this before. Language learners and medical

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.120
students in particular often use tools called spaced

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.400
repetition memory systems to remember vocabulary and basic

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.285
facts. But the same cognitive mechanisms should work

00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:07.285
for more complex conceptual knowledge as well. There

00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:10.485
are 112 of these questions scattered throughout the

00:18:10.485 --> 00:18:12.565
first chapter of the book on that basis.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.870
Quantum country is a kind of new medium,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.230
a mnemonic medium, integrating a spaced repetition memory

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.830
system with an explanatory text aspirationally to make

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.230
it easier for people to absorb complex material

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.375
reliably. We now have millions of practice data

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:31.055
points, so we can start to see how

00:18:31.055 --> 00:18:34.495
well it's working. This plot shows the amount

00:18:34.495 --> 00:18:37.215
of time spent practicing on the x axis

00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:41.960
versus the reader's demonstrated retention that is, how

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.480
long a reader was able to go without

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.960
practicing and still answer at least 90% of

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.880
questions correctly. These five dots represent the median

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.480
user's first five repetitions for the first chapter.

00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:56.865
Notice that the y axis is logarithmic, so

00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:59.505
this straight line plot we're seeing here represents

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:03.185
a very nice exponential growth. Each extra repetition,

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:06.145
which is a constant extra time input, yields

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:10.420
increasing output, I. E. Retention. And so in

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.340
exchange for about an hour and a half

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.060
of total practice, the median reader was able

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.020
to correctly answer over 100 detailed questions about

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.340
the first chapter after more than two months

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.295
without any practice. Now, the first chapter takes

00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:26.695
most readers about four hours to read the

00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:29.655
first time. So this plot implies that an

00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:32.375
extra overhead of less than 50% in time

00:19:32.375 --> 00:19:36.535
commitment can yield months or years of detailed

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:41.200
retention. It's also interesting to explore the counterfactual:

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.360
how much would people have forgotten if they

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.400
didn't have this extra reinforcement? So as an

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.120
experiment, we removed nine questions from the first

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.065
chapter for some readers and then covertly reinserted

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:54.385
the questions one month later into their practice

00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:58.545
sessions. This graph shows what happened. These nine

00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:01.745
points represent those nine questions. The y axis

00:20:01.745 --> 00:20:03.745
shows the percentage of readers who are able

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:05.820
to answer that question correctly after one month

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.300
with no support at all. You can see

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.620
that some questions are harder than others. All

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.140
the way over here on the left, one

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.060
month later, the majority of readers missed the

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.260
hardest three questions. And about thirty percent missed

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.580
the middle three, about fifteen percent missed the

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.555
easiest three. We can compare these to another

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.875
group of users who got practice while reading

00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:27.475
the essay, like we saw in the video

00:20:27.475 --> 00:20:30.275
a moment ago. And for any questions they

00:20:30.275 --> 00:20:31.795
missed, they got a bonus round of practice

00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:34.515
the next day. Then these questions disappeared for

00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:37.910
a month, at which point we tested. These

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.790
readers performed noticeably better, though a big chunk

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.710
of them are still missing several of these

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.870
questions. Now, here's one last group, like the

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.685
previous one, except they got just one extra

00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:51.525
round of practice a week after reading the

00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:53.525
book. Then we tested them again at the

00:20:53.525 --> 00:20:54.805
one month mark, and that's what you're seeing

00:20:54.805 --> 00:20:58.485
here. Each question takes six seconds on average

00:20:58.485 --> 00:21:00.485
to answer. So this is less than a

00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:02.725
minute of extra practice in total for these

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:05.120
nine questions. But now, for all of these

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.200
questions, at least 90% of readers were able

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.960
to answer correctly. Of course, some readers have

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.400
a much easier time than others. So the

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.200
left plot here focuses on the bottom quartile

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.215
of users. That is, the readers who missed

00:21:20.215 --> 00:21:22.055
the most questions while they were first reading

00:21:22.055 --> 00:21:24.455
the essay. Notice that I've had to lengthen

00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:26.855
the y axis downwards here because we can

00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:29.735
see that without any practice at all, most

00:21:29.735 --> 00:21:31.735
of these people in the bottom quartile forgot

00:21:31.735 --> 00:21:35.730
two thirds of these held out questions. If

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.490
they only had in essay practice, roughly half

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.890
of them were left for getting roughly half

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.810
of the questions. And here, with just one

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.050
extra round of practice, that extra slightly less

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.315
than a minute of extra practice, even this

00:21:50.315 --> 00:21:53.355
bottom quartile of readers performs quite well, almost

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:59.195
as well as the overall population. So this

00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:02.315
is the power of practice efficient practice, at

00:22:02.315 --> 00:22:05.970
least. And this mechanism is useful for more

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.570
than just quantum computing. In my personal practice,

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.210
I have accumulated thousands and thousands of questions.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.890
I write questions about scientific papers, about conversations,

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.155
about lectures, about memorable meals. I will definitely

00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:20.755
be writing a bunch about meetings I've had

00:22:20.755 --> 00:22:23.715
here today. All of this makes my daily

00:22:23.715 --> 00:22:26.835
life more rewarding because I know that if

00:22:26.835 --> 00:22:29.155
I invest my intention in something, I will

00:22:29.155 --> 00:22:33.000
internalize it indefinitely. Central to this is the

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.200
idea of a daily ritual, a vessel for

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.600
practice. Like meditation or exercise, I spend about

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.680
ten minutes a day using this memory system.

00:22:43.815 --> 00:22:46.775
And because these exponential schedules are very efficient,

00:22:46.775 --> 00:22:49.255
those ten minutes are enough to maintain my

00:22:49.255 --> 00:22:51.895
memory for thousands of these questions and to

00:22:51.895 --> 00:22:53.815
allow me to add about 40 new questions

00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:58.650
every day. But there are some problems. So

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.610
I want to mention a few of these

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.250
problems. One is pattern matching. Once a question

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.050
comes up a few times, I may recognize

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.370
the text of the question without really thinking

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.485
about its meaning. This creates the unpleasant feeling

00:23:12.485 --> 00:23:15.445
of parroting. But more importantly, I suspect it

00:23:15.445 --> 00:23:18.165
often leaves my memory brittle. I'll remember the

00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:21.045
answer, but only when queued exactly as I've

00:23:21.045 --> 00:23:23.765
practiced it. I wish the questions had more

00:23:23.765 --> 00:23:28.850
variability. Likewise, the questions are necessarily somewhat abstract.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.730
When I face a real problem in this

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.930
domain, I won't always recognize what knowledge I

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.690
should use or how to adapt it to

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.835
that medium. A cognitive scientist would say maybe

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:43.435
that I need to acquire schemas. Now, unless

00:23:43.435 --> 00:23:46.315
I intervene, these questions stay the same over

00:23:46.315 --> 00:23:49.595
years. They're maintaining my memory, but ideally they

00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:52.715
would push for further processing, increasing depth over

00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:57.250
time. And finally, returning to this talk's thesis,

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.210
memory systems are too often disconnected from my

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.730
authentic practice, what I'm actually interested in. Say

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.730
I'm studying a topic in signal processing for

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:10.065
a creative project. Unless I'm very careful, the

00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:11.985
questions that I get from that probably won't

00:24:11.985 --> 00:24:14.625
feel very connected to my project. They will

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:17.665
probably feel like generic textbook questions about signal

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:22.840
processing. Let's return to SAM now and see

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.280
if we can apply some of these ideas

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.960
about practice and memory. So Sam did the

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.360
work to study that signal processing material. They

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.360
want to make sure it actually sticks. How

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.560
might that work? Let's say they can install

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.115
a home screen widget, which ambiently exposes them

00:24:39.115 --> 00:24:43.275
to practice prompts drawn from highlights, questions asked,

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:45.275
and any other activity that the AI can

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:48.395
access. Sam can flip through these questions while

00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:51.220
waiting in line or on the bus. And

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.940
notice that this isn't a generic textbook signal

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.500
processing question. It's actually grounded in the details

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.460
of Sam's brain computer interface project so that,

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.740
at least aspirationally, practice feels somewhat more continuous

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.655
with authentic doing. These synthesized prompts can vary

00:25:08.655 --> 00:25:10.815
each time they're asked so that Sam gets

00:25:10.815 --> 00:25:15.695
practice accessing the same idea from different angles.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.980
The prompts get deeper and more complex over

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.460
time as Sam gets more confident with the

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.300
material. Notice also that this question isn't so

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.740
abstract. It's really about applying what Sam has

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.245
learned in a bite sized form factor that

00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:38.325
can do anywhere. Now the widget can also

00:25:38.325 --> 00:25:41.685
include kind of more open ended discussion questions.

00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:45.365
Why do we think Metzger et al downsampled

00:25:45.365 --> 00:25:50.420
their signals to 200 Hertz? Maybe it's for

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.620
performance? Here Sam gets some elaborative feedback and

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.405
extra detail to consider in their answer. Now

00:26:00.405 --> 00:26:02.485
when questions are synthesized like this, it's important

00:26:02.485 --> 00:26:06.725
that Sam can steer them with feedback assuring

00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:09.845
that future questions are synthesized accordingly. Because again,

00:26:09.845 --> 00:26:11.285
what we're trying to do here is to

00:26:11.285 --> 00:26:13.445
make all of this not be homework, but

00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:15.570
to actually support what Sam is really trying

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.250
to do. So far we've been looking at

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.250
bite sized questions Sam can answer while they're

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.410
out and about. But if they make time

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.570
for a longer dedicated session, we can suggest

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.055
meatier tasks like this one. And what's more,

00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:30.895
we can move that work out of fake

00:26:30.895 --> 00:26:34.335
practice land and into Sam's real context here

00:26:34.335 --> 00:26:37.775
at Jupyter Notebook. Notice that the task is

00:26:37.775 --> 00:26:40.335
still framed in terms of Sam's specific aims

00:26:40.335 --> 00:26:45.750
rather than some generic signal processing pipeline. Now,

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.990
Sam got into this project not as a

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.030
learning exercise, but as a way to start

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.390
legitimately participating to start working with BCIs while

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.705
playing to existing strengths. So just as our

00:26:57.705 --> 00:26:59.705
AI can help Sam find a tractable way

00:26:59.705 --> 00:27:02.265
into this space, it can also facilitate connections

00:27:02.265 --> 00:27:04.985
to communities of practice, here suggesting a local

00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:08.025
neurotech meetup. So let's say Sam goes to

00:27:08.025 --> 00:27:10.745
this meetup, meets a local scientist, and sets

00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:14.320
up a coffee date. With permission, Sam records

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.960
the meeting, knowing the notes will probably be

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.200
helpful later. And of course, Sam ends up

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.840
surprised and intrigued quite a lot in this

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.400
conversation. Our AI can notice these moments of

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.945
surprise and help Sam metabolize them. Here, that

00:27:30.945 --> 00:27:36.865
insight turns into a reflective practice prompt. Four

00:27:36.865 --> 00:27:39.585
big design principles are threaded through Sam's story.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.770
I'd like to review them now, and for

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.010
each, point out the ways that AI has

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:48.730
helped me think about them. First, we bring

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.650
guided learning to authentic contexts rather than thinking

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.195
about it as a separate activity. We're able

00:27:55.195 --> 00:27:57.195
to make that happen by imagining an AI

00:27:57.195 --> 00:27:59.995
which can perceive and act across applications on

00:27:59.995 --> 00:28:03.195
Sam's computer. And as the audio transcript at

00:28:03.195 --> 00:28:05.435
the end of the story here alluded to,

00:28:05.915 --> 00:28:08.555
that action can potentially extend to activities outside

00:28:08.555 --> 00:28:11.830
of the computer as well. The AI can

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.190
give appropriate guidance in part because, with permission

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.910
and executing locally, it can learn from every

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.230
piece of text that has ever crossed Sam's

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.950
screen, every action they've ever taken on the

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.635
computer. It can synthesize scaffolded dynamic media so

00:28:27.635 --> 00:28:30.195
that Sam can learn by doing, but with

00:28:30.195 --> 00:28:35.715
guidance. And then, when explicit learning activities are

00:28:35.715 --> 00:28:40.090
necessary, we suffuse them with authentic context. The

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.970
AI in our story grounds all of the

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.050
reading and practice Sam's doing in their actual

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.410
aims. It helps Sam match the learning activities

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.450
to their depth of interest. And it draws

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.250
on important moments that happen while Sam is

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.905
doing, like insights from that coffee meeting at

00:28:56.905 --> 00:28:59.865
the end or questions asked while implementing parts

00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:02.585
of the project. And it brings those moments

00:29:02.585 --> 00:29:07.225
into study activities. Besides connecting these two domains,

00:29:07.305 --> 00:29:11.400
we can also strengthen each of them. So

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.360
our AI suggests tractable ways for Sam to

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.800
just dive in to a new interest. And

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.200
it helps Sam build connections with a community

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.765
of practice. On the other side, when we

00:29:23.765 --> 00:29:26.085
are spending time in explicit learning activities, let's

00:29:26.085 --> 00:29:29.445
make sure that they actually work. So our

00:29:29.445 --> 00:29:32.725
AI creates a dynamic vessel for ongoing reinforcement.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.685
It varies what's in that vessel over time

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.190
so that knowledge transfers more effectively to real

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:42.270
situations. And it doesn't just maintain memory. It

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.470
increases depth of understanding over time. Now I'd

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.190
like to give two cheers for chatbot tutors.

00:29:51.095 --> 00:29:53.895
Most discussion of AI and education at the

00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:56.455
moment revolves around the framing of chatbot tutors.

00:29:56.455 --> 00:29:58.935
And I think this framing correctly identifies something

00:29:58.935 --> 00:30:01.655
really wonderful about language models, which is that

00:30:01.655 --> 00:30:03.815
they are so good at answering long tail

00:30:03.815 --> 00:30:06.610
questions if the user can articulate the question

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.930
clearly enough. And if the user is trying

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.570
to perform a routine task, chatbot tutors can

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.130
often diagnose problems and find good ways to

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.345
get the user unstuck. And that's great. But

00:30:17.345 --> 00:30:19.425
when I look at others' visions of chatbot

00:30:19.425 --> 00:30:21.985
tutors through the broader framing that we've been

00:30:21.985 --> 00:30:24.705
discussing, they're clearly missing a lot of what

00:30:24.705 --> 00:30:28.225
I want. I think these visions often fail

00:30:28.225 --> 00:30:29.665
to take seriously just how much a real

00:30:29.665 --> 00:30:32.160
tutor can really do. Large part, I think

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.920
that's because the authors of these visions are

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.680
usually thinking about educating, something they want to

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.360
do to others rather than learning, something they

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.715
want for themselves. Now a sad truth about

00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:46.795
the world is that postdocs and graduate students

00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:50.155
are incredibly underpaid. So it is actually surprisingly

00:30:50.155 --> 00:30:51.675
affordable to get an expert tutor for a

00:30:51.675 --> 00:30:55.115
technical topic I care about. But if I

00:30:55.115 --> 00:30:56.940
hire a real tutor as an adult to

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.100
learn about signal processing, I will tell them

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.420
about my interest in brain computer interfaces. And

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.820
I will expect them to ground every conversation

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.220
in that purpose. My goal here is not

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.340
to learn signal processing. It is to participate

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.495
in the creation of brain computer interfaces. Chatbot

00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:14.895
tutors are not interested in what I'm trying

00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:17.215
to do. There's a set of things they

00:31:17.215 --> 00:31:19.695
think I should know or should be able

00:31:19.695 --> 00:31:21.855
to do, and they view me as defective

00:31:21.855 --> 00:31:25.550
until I say the right things. If I

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.390
hire a real tutor, I might ask them

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.670
to sit beside me as I try to

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.150
actually do something involving the material. They can

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.990
see everything I'm doing, see what I'm pointing

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.470
at. And if it's appropriate, I can scoot

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.070
over and they can drive for a minute.

00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:40.395
By comparison, the typical conception of a chatbot

00:31:40.395 --> 00:31:43.755
tutor lives in a windowless box, and it

00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:45.755
can only see whatever's provided on scraps of

00:31:45.755 --> 00:31:48.155
paper passed under the door. It can have

00:31:48.155 --> 00:31:52.080
no effect on the outside world. My goal

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.880
here is to dive in, to immerse myself,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.840
to start doing the thing. But these chatbot

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.760
tutors can't join me where the action is.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.040
So interactions with them create distance and pull

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.145
me away from immersion. If I hire a

00:32:06.145 --> 00:32:10.225
real tutor, we'll build a relationship. With every

00:32:10.225 --> 00:32:12.705
session, they'll learn more about me: my interests,

00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:15.985
my strengths, my confusions. Chatbot tutors, on the

00:32:15.985 --> 00:32:20.060
other hand, as typically conceived, are transactional, amnesiac.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.700
Now, we can fix that as context windows

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.540
get longer. But that relationship is also important

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.380
to my emotional connection. If I view conversation

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.645
with my tutor as a kind of peripheral

00:32:32.645 --> 00:32:35.605
participation in the community I'm hoping to enter,

00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:38.085
an interaction between a novice in the discipline

00:32:38.085 --> 00:32:41.045
and an expert in the discipline, then tutoring

00:32:41.045 --> 00:32:44.160
just becomes part of doing the thing. But

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.560
if my interaction with the tutor is transactional,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.480
that will tend to make my tutoring sessions

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.160
feel like learning time, separate from doing the

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.920
thing. Finally, people talk about how Aristotle was

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.045
a tutor for Alexander the Great. But what's

00:32:59.045 --> 00:33:01.445
most valuable about having Aristotle as your tutor

00:33:01.445 --> 00:33:04.645
is not that he can diagnose misconceptions, but

00:33:04.645 --> 00:33:07.045
rather that he's modeling the practices and values

00:33:07.045 --> 00:33:10.850
of an earnest, intellectually engaged adult. He's He's

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.010
demonstrating how and why he thinks about problems

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.050
his taste and the discipline. The high growth

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.290
periods that we love transform the way that

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.490
we see the world. They reshape our identity.

00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:26.295
In my demo earlier, I showed a chatbot,

00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:28.135
but it didn't really work like most chatbot

00:33:28.135 --> 00:33:31.735
tutors I described. It focused all its actions

00:33:31.735 --> 00:33:34.375
on the user's interests rather than bringing its

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:36.615
own agenda. It wasn't trapped in a little

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.255
text box. It could see and take action

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.310
in the context of authentic use. It can

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.950
communicate through dynamic media. It had a deep

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.190
memory drawing on everything I'd ever seen and

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.070
written. So in some ways, the system I've

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.190
shown is more like a real tutor. But

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.030
in my ideal world, I don't want a

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.775
tutor. I want to legitimately participate in some

00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:01.015
new discipline and learn what I need as

00:34:01.015 --> 00:34:03.975
much as possible from interaction with real practitioners.

00:34:04.535 --> 00:34:06.615
So I view the role of the augmented

00:34:06.615 --> 00:34:09.760
learning system as helping me act on my

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.320
creative interests, ideally by letting me just dive

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.880
in and start doing as much as possible.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.080
That will often mean scaffolding connections to and

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.055
interactions with communities of practice. One theme for

00:34:23.055 --> 00:34:25.455
this Design at Large series is the ethics

00:34:25.455 --> 00:34:28.895
of AI and its likely enormous social impacts.

00:34:29.055 --> 00:34:30.735
So let me say, I am tremendously worried

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.975
about those impacts in the general case. I

00:34:32.975 --> 00:34:34.895
am worried about despots locking in their powers.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:39.550
Lowering the bar to bioweapons, economic chaos. I

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.750
would not feel comfortable ethically with researching more

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.390
powerful frontier models myself. But within the narrower

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.875
domain of learning that we've been discussing, my

00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:52.195
main moral concern is that we will end

00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:56.755
up trapped in a sad, narrow future. A

00:34:56.755 --> 00:35:00.435
condescending authoritarian frame dominates the narrative in the

00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:03.420
future of learning. I'll caricature it to make

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.700
the point. With AI, we can finally take

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.620
all of these defective kids that don't know

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.700
the stuff they're supposed to know and get

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.180
them to know it. You know, that's personalized

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.820
learning. The AI lets us precisely identify where

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.265
the kids are wrong or where they're ignorant

00:35:18.265 --> 00:35:20.745
and fix them. Then we can fill their

00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:22.185
heads to the brim with what's good for

00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:26.185
them. By contrast, the famous bicycle for the

00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:29.065
mind metaphor has no agenda other than the

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:31.480
one that you bring. It just lets you

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.320
reach a wider range of destinations than you

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.000
could on foot, and it makes the journey

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.320
more fun, maybe particularly if you're biking along

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.040
with some friends. The bicycle asks, Where do

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.240
you want to go? Of course, that question

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.535
assumes your destination is well known and charted

00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:50.055
on some map. But those most rewarding, high

00:35:50.055 --> 00:35:53.095
growth experiences are often centered on a creative

00:35:53.095 --> 00:35:55.335
project. You're trying to get somewhere no one's

00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:57.575
ever gone before to reach the frontier and

00:35:57.575 --> 00:36:01.350
then starting charting links into the unknown. Learning

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.190
in service of creation. It's a dynamic, context

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.470
laden kind of learning. It's about more than

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.910
just efficiency and correctness. More than just faster

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.725
gears on a bike. And that's the kind

00:36:14.725 --> 00:36:16.565
of learning that I feel an almost moral

00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:28.310
imperative to help create. Thank you. I think

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.310
we maybe have time for questions. We have

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:38.470
some time for questions. Love to talk. Thank

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.310
you. I really like a lot of what

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.825
you said. One One thing that I'm curious

00:36:41.825 --> 00:36:44.465
about is you mentioned that you add questions

00:36:45.025 --> 00:36:48.545
to your own, like for your space repetition

00:36:48.545 --> 00:36:50.625
routine, you add questions every And you said

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:53.025
you add 40 questions a day. So I

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:55.510
guess what I'm wondering is, in your example

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.910
you took one topic, but many people are

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.790
often learning multiple things. And very often we

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.550
don't know that we want to learn something

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.150
until we've built some momentum. So my question

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.990
is broadly, how do you decide what questions

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.150
you want to add and how do you

00:37:11.085 --> 00:37:13.245
plan for your future self in some way?

00:37:13.245 --> 00:37:16.125
Right, right. First, should clarify. So I don't,

00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:18.685
in fact, add 40 questions a day. That

00:37:18.685 --> 00:37:22.125
is the carrying capacity of my practice time.

00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:24.605
Ten minutes will support 40 a day added.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.170
In practice, it ends up like some kind

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.930
of Poisson distribution or something. But how do

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.610
I do this? How do I plan appropriately?

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.250
You can't know what's going to be important

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.290
to you in advance. Sometimes you can, but

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:41.375
in general you can't. So the system needs

00:37:41.375 --> 00:37:43.295
to be resilient to that. The way that

00:37:43.295 --> 00:37:46.575
that works right now is very coarse. You

00:37:46.575 --> 00:37:48.495
can delete questions that you add if you

00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:50.895
decide that you don't like them. I view

00:37:50.895 --> 00:37:52.655
this as an interface problem of sorts. I

00:37:52.655 --> 00:37:54.660
think ideally you don't need to plan for

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.340
what's going to be important. You can just

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.300
do stuff, and stuff will get reinforced, and

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.060
you can steer more of this, less of

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.860
that. And I think that's an interesting challenge

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.020
in interface design to create systems that behave

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.015
more like that and less like these kind

00:38:10.015 --> 00:38:15.055
of discrete destructive actions destroy this question. Andy,

00:38:15.055 --> 00:38:17.855
I love that vision over here for that.

00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:21.295
Especially liked how you talked about how the

00:38:21.295 --> 00:38:24.810
AI could reinforce things you've learned and challenge

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.530
you. It could integrate you with communities. Love

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.330
all those ideas. What I didn't get, and

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.010
maybe I guess I walked in two minutes

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.930
late, was that an actual demo that you've

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.170
created? No. Or is that just a vision

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.475
for how you want it to be in

00:38:39.475 --> 00:38:41.555
the future? Yeah, I'm sorry for not making

00:38:41.555 --> 00:38:43.315
that clear. If wasn't, I thought it looked

00:38:43.315 --> 00:38:47.555
sufficiently fake. No, this is concept art. Thank

00:38:47.555 --> 00:38:50.275
you for asking. There is, I suppose, a

00:38:50.275 --> 00:38:52.595
grand tradition in our discipline of smoke and

00:38:52.595 --> 00:38:56.420
mirror concept art. I have been using this

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.420
talk as an excuse to figure out what

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.020
I think I want to do with respect

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.220
to AI and learning. And so these drawings

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:11.335
are part of that process. I was curious,

00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:14.135
I wanted to follow-up on the question about

00:39:15.255 --> 00:39:17.415
sometimes I don't know what I want. And

00:39:17.415 --> 00:39:19.095
I think if you look at some of

00:39:19.095 --> 00:39:24.570
the more Montessori or Papert esque learning experiences,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.570
when you know when you have like, you

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.850
know, if you just said school is gonna

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.570
be whatever you're interested in forever. Yeah. It

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:38.025
has lots of benefits. A challenge is that

00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:41.385
there are topics that I might benefit from,

00:39:41.385 --> 00:39:44.585
and I loved your paternalistic caricature as being

00:39:44.585 --> 00:39:46.825
that's what we don't want. There is a,

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.390
like, the psychologist Dan Gilbert defines the happiness

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.830
challenge as the delta between our current self

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.990
and what our future self would have wanted

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.270
us to do. I can, like a nice

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.135
thing about a good tutor, your talk for

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:06.695
example, is I'm learning things that will be

00:40:06.695 --> 00:40:08.855
valuable to me in the future that at

00:40:08.855 --> 00:40:11.495
04:00 today I wouldn't have thought to ask

00:40:11.495 --> 00:40:14.375
for. Right. Yeah, yeah, I think this is

00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:16.190
totally right. I think the way that I

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.110
think about this is a kind of unbundling.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.110
Normally when we think about schooling, we ask

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.430
schooling to do two jobs: one, to decide

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.790
what is it that I should know and

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.390
then two, to cause me to know it.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.270
I think there are all kinds of cultural

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.335
institutions that help us figure out what is

00:40:30.335 --> 00:40:32.735
it that we want to know. In the

00:40:32.735 --> 00:40:34.655
example that I showed, Sam figures out that

00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:36.655
they may be interested in brain computer interfaces

00:40:36.655 --> 00:40:40.095
through Twitter. If you are in San Diego,

00:40:40.095 --> 00:40:42.770
you can decide to attend this talk. Ideally,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.130
it doesn't feel like schooling. Hope it doesn't

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.730
feel like schooling. And you can decide, oh,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.410
maybe I'm interested in studying some of the

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.890
cognitive science that Andy mentioned. So I think

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.410
there's a variety of cultural institutions and venues

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.810
and channels we can use to help deliver

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:01.175
that first part, and then possibly use separate

00:41:01.175 --> 00:41:07.335
tools for the other part. Good afternoon. Should

00:41:07.335 --> 00:41:09.575
we be planning for the day where we

00:41:09.575 --> 00:41:12.775
won't have to work due to artificial intelligence,

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:18.030
automation, computers and robotics? Your thoughts. Thank you.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.110
I'm so grateful that you asked that question

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.790
because I spent a month preparing for this

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:25.950
talk, writing another version of this talk that

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.825
I didn't give that was called What's Worth

00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:30.865
Learning in the Age of Strong AI? And

00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:32.705
it didn't end up aligning, so I didn't

00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:34.385
end up getting to present any of it.

00:41:35.105 --> 00:41:39.940
I'll give you a piece of that. Say

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.900
that you are a composer, and you have

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.140
some very vague idea about a new cello

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.100
concerto that you would like to write. I

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.180
claim that you can't just ask the AI

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.475
to write it for you, because you don't

00:41:54.475 --> 00:41:57.275
know what it is that you want. In

00:41:57.275 --> 00:41:58.955
fact, you discover what the cello concerto is

00:41:58.955 --> 00:42:00.795
supposed to be through the process of composing

00:42:00.795 --> 00:42:05.835
it. Likewise, when we talk about software. An

00:42:05.835 --> 00:42:08.620
interesting thing about software is that it feels

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.300
so messy and unpleasant so much of the

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.380
time. We want a particular piece of software.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.980
We ask some people to go start making

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.900
it for us. And then they come back

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.180
3x over time, 3x over budget, one third

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.420
x quality. Why is software so hard? Why

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.035
can't we just tell the system what we

00:42:24.035 --> 00:42:26.995
want and get the thing out the other

00:42:26.995 --> 00:42:29.235
side? And it turns out we actually do

00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:31.875
have that kind of technology. It's called formal

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.635
modeling. We've had it for a long time.

00:42:33.955 --> 00:42:35.235
And I think the reason why it's not

00:42:35.235 --> 00:42:37.210
more widely used is that that's not how

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.570
we think about designing software. Namely, we figure

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.490
out what software we want in the process

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:47.210
of making it. It's continuously negotiated. It's contingent.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.530
So I think there are many activities in

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.915
human life that have that characteristic where we

00:42:51.915 --> 00:42:54.395
can't actually appropriately specify what it is that

00:42:54.395 --> 00:42:55.995
we want to the model. We can't externalize

00:42:55.995 --> 00:42:57.595
it or make it legible. We have to

00:42:57.595 --> 00:43:00.475
participate in the creation of the thing. And

00:43:00.475 --> 00:43:01.595
then we can ask, what do we need

00:43:01.595 --> 00:43:03.355
to know in order to participate in that

00:43:03.355 --> 00:43:05.355
creation? What are the dynamics of that participation?

00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:08.440
How much injection of involvement is necessary to

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.120
steer appropriately. And I have some thoughts on

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.720
that, but I should probably move on to

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.040
the next question. So yes, I hope that's

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:23.065
somewhat helpful. Yeah. Hi. So with my question,

00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:25.545
I was thinking about how with the AI,

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:27.465
what you have is you like say that

00:43:27.465 --> 00:43:30.105
AI advancement will lead to some dystopian feature

00:43:30.105 --> 00:43:31.705
where we find people the knowledge and then

00:43:31.705 --> 00:43:33.980
we force them to know it. But who's

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.420
to say that that is still already happening

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.340
to some extent with curriculum right now without

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.260
AI? Isn't necessarily a concern as much as

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.260
other things, I think. But beyond that, I

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.900
think it's kind of like, because that problem

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.635
can happen, like when we don't look at

00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:49.715
the root problem, it can happen in the

00:43:49.715 --> 00:43:52.755
most immersive learning. In ethnic studies class you

00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:54.835
can still end up restricting someone to that

00:43:54.835 --> 00:43:57.395
specific topic instead of connecting identity as much

00:43:57.395 --> 00:43:58.755
as you would in say a math class

00:43:58.755 --> 00:44:01.100
or something like that. So what if you

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.860
could implement that like sort of, I guess

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.020
to give another example of how in the

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.180
other hand, you can do something really well,

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.260
even in a math class, for example, if

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.860
you look at the higher concepts or if

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.705
someone explains it really well, or in like

00:44:14.705 --> 00:44:17.105
say neuroscience and those sorts of fields, there

00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:18.945
might be content that is above the cost

00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:21.105
that is interesting that would make someone more

00:44:21.105 --> 00:44:23.505
interested and able to learn the class themselves,

00:44:23.665 --> 00:44:25.505
especially if it connects to their own prior

00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:27.890
knowledge. So what would you think if like,

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.930
guess, how do you think you would implement

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.090
this into like a learning system to take

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:34.930
advantage of it like say Canvas? Do you

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.050
think that you could do it in a

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.690
way that you could customize in part assignments

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.570
to synthesize the students' interests and the teachers'

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.655
intent to teach people necessary content and teach

00:44:44.655 --> 00:44:46.735
people the content that they want to know

00:44:46.735 --> 00:44:48.415
in a way that they might be doing

00:44:48.415 --> 00:44:50.815
more, but ultimately less because it's easier for

00:44:50.815 --> 00:44:52.655
them if they know the context and can

00:44:52.655 --> 00:44:56.220
connect to it. Cool. I think I followed.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.700
So to your first question, yeah, I think

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.580
you're right. That part of the talk was

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.060
part of a complaint about schooling in general.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.545
And AI doesn't necessarily make that worse, though

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:16.985
it may continue trends I don't like. To

00:45:17.065 --> 00:45:20.585
your second point, or your second question, I

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:24.585
have deliberately avoided the question of schooling in

00:45:24.585 --> 00:45:28.240
this talk. And I did that for a

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.640
reason. I think it makes everything very complicated.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.600
So in terms of integrating into Canvas, I

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.040
think it's a very difficult position to start.

00:45:40.355 --> 00:45:43.475
I have done a bunch of collaborations these

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:47.555
past few years with professors in higher ed

00:45:48.035 --> 00:45:52.275
teaching large classes. And what I experience again

00:45:52.275 --> 00:45:56.200
and again is just an enormous fraction of

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.920
the student body that is just fundamentally not

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.800
engaged with the class. And I don't think

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.360
any amount of UI chicanery or AI involvement

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.645
is going to change that. And I think

00:46:09.645 --> 00:46:11.565
I basically don't want to put myself into

00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:13.885
that problem solving situation. In some sense, that's

00:46:13.885 --> 00:46:18.445
actually why I left Khan Academy. Hey, Andy.

00:46:18.445 --> 00:46:20.685
My name's Taylor. I'm a software engineer at

00:46:20.685 --> 00:46:23.480
Replit. So I would say, in some sense,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.480
my salary depends on some of the ideas

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.240
in your talk, which is to say that

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.320
AI can be an effective tool for teaching

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.240
difficult concepts like computer programming. So my question

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.680
to you is, have you seen any inklings

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.865
of this being true, the ideas in your

00:46:39.865 --> 00:46:43.225
talk of the delta between something like a

00:46:43.225 --> 00:46:47.065
GBT, being a teacher, and what you're outlining?

00:46:47.145 --> 00:46:50.425
Have you seen any of those ideas actually

00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:52.020
start to play out? Or do you think

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.860
this is purely speculative with what we have

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.820
today? Yeah. I think we're seeing a lot

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.340
of hints at what I described already. So

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.735
lots of people already use GPT to just

00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:09.975
dive into stuff. It's missing that universal IO.

00:47:09.975 --> 00:47:13.655
It's missing the billion token context window. And

00:47:13.655 --> 00:47:16.055
yet it's still already able to deliver some

00:47:16.455 --> 00:47:20.220
value, which is great. I think missing also

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.140
that the bridge to textbooks again and again,

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.140
I've been talking to people not that textbooks

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.820
are the answer. Here I'm using textbook as

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.540
synecdoche for some kind of deeper, more focused

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.745
learning experience. I talk to a lot of

00:47:33.745 --> 00:47:37.425
people who get a really good start with

00:47:37.425 --> 00:47:40.065
GPT because they can get the couple sentence

00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:41.825
answers, and that lets them make a certain

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.665
amount of progress. And that's really motivating. You

00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.505
can kick up some momentum, and momentum is

00:47:45.505 --> 00:47:49.080
very powerful. But they hit a wall. And

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.480
I had a section that I cut talking

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.960
about programming. I think it's really interesting that

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.360
in programming, a lot of people can manage

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.480
to self teach programming. And in part, I

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.435
think that's because of things like syntax, for

00:48:02.435 --> 00:48:04.755
instance, is reinforced every time you sit down

00:48:04.755 --> 00:48:08.515
to program. Obscure facets of syntax, which are

00:48:08.515 --> 00:48:11.475
not reinforced regularly, like maybe your macro library

00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:15.635
or whatever, people do tend to forget. But

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.990
again and again you meet people who are

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:22.510
like, I don't understand how pointers work though.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.670
That asterisk can see. It's like it's a

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.590
bridge too far. So there's a certain amount

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.870
of conceptual understanding that seems acquirable with the

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.270
frontier of self learning tools that are widely

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.635
available. And then as soon as you run

00:48:34.635 --> 00:48:37.675
into difficult conceptual territory, it's just a cliff.

00:48:37.675 --> 00:48:41.275
So I think we're seeing glimmers of progress

00:48:41.355 --> 00:48:44.235
in this vein, and perhaps this talk will

00:48:44.235 --> 00:48:49.880
inspire people to try some more stuff. Hello.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.160
Hi. So my question is, to what extent

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.760
do you think the desire to learn comes

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.800
from the innate pleasure of learning or specific

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.005
to whatever material the person learning is? And

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:04.085
to what extent do you think the desire

00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:06.885
to learn comes from some sort of use

00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:08.965
of the material the person learns? And do

00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:14.005
you think making this distinction is important to

00:49:14.005 --> 00:49:17.770
the design of systems for learning? Yeah, probably.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.730
This is a good question, and it's something

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.930
that I don't emphasize perhaps quite clearly enough.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.170
In the example story that I gave, everything

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.715
is motivated by this persona, Sam, wanting to

00:49:31.715 --> 00:49:33.715
do a project. It's very concrete. It's out

00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:38.275
in the world. That doesn't mean that curiosity

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:41.315
based learning is any less legitimate or that

00:49:41.315 --> 00:49:43.075
I think any of the claims don't apply.

00:49:43.075 --> 00:49:46.010
It's just that what authentic practice and legitimate

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.850
participation looks like is different. So in mathematics,

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.450
for instance, which may be very abstract, it

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.050
may not be like a project I'm trying

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.050
to do as I learn about algebraic topology

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:58.225
or something like that, What legitimate practice looks

00:49:58.225 --> 00:50:01.905
like is engaging with problems and questions in

00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:07.825
algebraic topology that I find authentically interesting. And

00:50:07.825 --> 00:50:09.505
as soon as you make that move, rather

00:50:09.505 --> 00:50:10.865
than thinking about, well, I need to learn

00:50:10.865 --> 00:50:12.920
algebraic topology in order to do this four

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.520
d renderer that I was working on for

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.760
a game project, if you think about it

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.160
from the perspective of authentic curiosity, then I

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.920
think much of what I'm saying applies. However,

00:50:24.365 --> 00:50:28.445
there are issues with rendering legible the nature

00:50:28.445 --> 00:50:30.445
of the curiosity and the interest to the

00:50:30.445 --> 00:50:33.805
AI. A lot of what's happening is internal,

00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.405
and that may make a lot of what

00:50:35.405 --> 00:50:40.240
I'm describing somewhat more difficult. The nature of

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.120
relation to community of practices changes somewhat, although

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.280
not completely. So it's a partial answer, I

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.920
suppose. Is there someone with the microphone? Hi,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.485
Jonathan. Hi, Andy. This is great. Love the

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:58.325
deepness of the reflective practice you're demonstrating for

00:50:58.325 --> 00:51:02.485
us I think, is it Aristotle that said,

00:51:02.645 --> 00:51:04.405
give me a child till the age of

00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.980
seven and I'll show you the man? And

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.780
when you bring up the ethical issues, this

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.660
is what scares me the most is for

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:20.695
an AI tutor. Have you thought about adversarial

00:51:20.695 --> 00:51:24.695
tutoring? Given that we're going to have, if

00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:27.335
we do, if we hypothesize AI tutors are

00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:29.255
out there and that we have the schooling

00:51:29.255 --> 00:51:34.050
industrial complex producing them, how do we counteract

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.770
them? I love that. It's like manufacturing the

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.970
mythical and often in the teaching community maligned

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:47.090
Robin Williams character, the teacher film whose name

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.875
I'm forgetting. I haven't thought about that. It's

00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:57.035
a lovely provocation. I feel uncomfortable with an

00:51:57.755 --> 00:52:00.155
activist framing, where it's like, I need to

00:52:00.155 --> 00:52:02.315
get out there because I know what's best

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.720
for the people or for the kids. They're

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.160
doing it wrong. I'm going make a thing

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.560
that's going to put fluoride in the drinking

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.200
water so that they end up in the

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:17.385
right spot. I'm uncomfortable with that. I feel

00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:19.465
much more comfortable saying, well, I can make

00:52:19.465 --> 00:52:20.585
a thing that lets you pursue the things

00:52:20.585 --> 00:52:22.265
you're interested in, if you would like that.

00:52:22.745 --> 00:52:26.905
That feels less complicated. So I will need

00:52:26.905 --> 00:52:28.665
to think about your question. Find it very

00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:35.820
provocative. Thank you. Hey, Andy. I have a

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.020
question for you about this idea of that

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.500
AI tutor. I'm wondering, is there a limit

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.755
to what kind of disciplines that that course

00:52:46.755 --> 00:52:49.315
kind of technology could be applied to? I've

00:52:49.315 --> 00:52:52.515
always deemed myself as being book smarts but

00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:57.155
not street smarts. That's a great question. One

00:52:57.155 --> 00:53:00.470
of the inspirations for this talk was trying

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.630
to exorcise myself of the young ladies illustrated

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.310
primer. I don't know if that phrase means

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.950
anything to you. Ah, that's a shame. Okay,

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.855
so an inspiration for many educational technologists is

00:53:12.855 --> 00:53:14.295
this book called The Diamond Age by Neal

00:53:14.295 --> 00:53:17.575
Stephenson, which depicts a sort of far future

00:53:17.575 --> 00:53:21.335
utopian learning environment. It's like a magical book

00:53:22.935 --> 00:53:25.870
that transforms a young girl's life. And one

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.550
of the things that's interesting about this book

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:29.150
that I think is underappreciated is that it

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:31.550
is almost exclusively focused on street smarts. So

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.270
this book teaches her martial arts and getting

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.590
out of sticky situations and persuading people and

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.965
so on. And I chose not to deal

00:53:40.965 --> 00:53:45.205
with any of that. I think the way

00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:49.045
that I would handle much of that looks

00:53:49.045 --> 00:53:53.000
very different. And I'm afraid I haven't really

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.480
thought about how I would handle that. It's

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.000
difficult to think about authentic practice of street

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.360
smarts. Like what does that look like? Is

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.675
it like I'm going to go to a

00:54:06.835 --> 00:54:09.075
bad neighborhood and like look purposeful as I

00:54:09.075 --> 00:54:12.355
walk? And then but that's not exactly authentic

00:54:12.355 --> 00:54:14.035
practice because like you went to this neighborhood

00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:16.835
just for that purpose. So I find myself

00:54:16.835 --> 00:54:21.590
confused thinking about this. And I find myself

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.670
most comfortable when I think about people who

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.430
enjoy practicing martial arts not as a kind

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:35.435
of preparatory measure for imagined conflict in the

00:54:35.435 --> 00:54:37.355
future, but rather because they like the way

00:54:37.355 --> 00:54:39.035
it makes their body feel. They like their

00:54:39.035 --> 00:54:42.955
community at the dojo. And so if we

00:54:42.955 --> 00:54:45.890
start thinking about that, like, oh, it would

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:47.890
be fun to do some exercise with others,

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.610
then I think some of the same techniques

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:53.490
can help. So you can probably use tools

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.050
to help you find an appropriate community and

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.530
perhaps to help you practice appropriately. I play

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.775
the piano. And that's not exactly book smart,

00:55:01.775 --> 00:55:05.375
but one can use practice systems, vessels for

00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:08.655
practice like I've described, to orchestrate piano practice.

00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:11.615
You can imagine extending that to martial arts.

00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:12.815
I don't know about other kinds of street

00:55:12.815 --> 00:55:16.780
smarts, but perhaps. Thanks for the question. Let's

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.540
thank Andy, and I'm sure he'll stay around

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:23.980
a few little. Thanks everybody. Appreciate you.
