00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.160
Alright. Can everyone hear me okay? Can y'all

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400
hear me in the back? Alright. Amazing. And

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.760
Zoom people, let me know if you can't

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.360
hear me or anything. Okay. First off, welcome

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.675
everyone to WebLab. I am so it makes

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.075
me so excited to see you guys. I'm

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:20.155
Abby. I am the academic chair for WebLab,

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:21.755
which means I am in charge of coordinating

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.795
basically everything that you all of the academic

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.635
lecture content that you see over the next

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:28.510
two weeks. So if you have a problem

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.110
with the lecture content and you're like, Oh

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.230
my gosh, this was terrible, or, Please help,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.110
then come ask me. Any questions are okay.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.510
So we're gonna start by learning about Git.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.990
If you have a CS background, you probably

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.630
already know Git to some extent. If you

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.525
do, feel to tune me out. But hopefully

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:50.325
this lecture will be helpful. Is So WebLab

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:52.805
is designed to be friendly to people who

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:55.525
have no coding experience whatsoever, which is why

00:00:55.525 --> 00:00:58.620
we're starting from ground zero. However, it does

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.740
go fast. So if we're going through Git

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.900
stuff or whatever and you don't understand and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.220
you get lost, please just don't worry about

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.220
it. Take a breath. You can come to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.900
office hours and we'll help you learn the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.915
concepts And also, you'll just get familiar with

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:14.675
it as you keep going on and doing

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.755
more of it. So don't worry if you

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.715
cannot pick up 100% of it at the

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:23.475
very beginning. So yeah. Without further ado, let's

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:27.240
dive into it. So the main question for

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.720
today is how do we collaborate on code?

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.480
This is Tony, he was co academic chair

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.080
with me last year. This is Tisai, you'll

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.920
meet him soon, and that's me. And we're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.200
working together on a coding project. So how

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.665
do we work together? Well, you might think,

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.545
let's do something like Google Docs, but Google

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:49.305
Code. And it'll live update, so any changes

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:51.465
I make, everyone will be able to immediately

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:56.940
see. That's great, right? Well, not quite. Consider

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.060
the following. So let's say that Tony and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.300
Nick are working together on this project, and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.820
Nick is working on the home page while

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.140
Tony is simultaneously working on another part of

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.380
the website that the home page needs in

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.675
order to run. And then Tony is working

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.115
on it, and then the thing that he's

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:15.795
working on goes down as he is making

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:17.795
his improvements. And Nick is like, bro, what

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:20.115
happened? And Tony is very happy about the

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.195
upgrades that he's making. But Nick is not

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:24.035
as happy about the upgrades Tony is making.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.170
And so the basic idea is we need

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.650
independent copies of the code so that both

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.650
Nick and Tony can work on the code,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.250
or Nick can work on his part while

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.410
Tony can work on his part, but if

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.855
Tony breaks this thing as he's making his

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:42.855
upgrades, Nick still has a copy of the

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:45.975
old working version of whatever Tony was working

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.215
on so that he can still work on

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:53.110
his homepage. But then if we have independent

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.790
copies of the code, that creates a lot

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.390
of problems for us. Because now, typically when

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.910
we're coding, we don't have just one file.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.670
We have a heck ton of files. And

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.430
so there are all these files that Nick

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.110
has a copy of and Tony has a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.815
copy of. And let's say they're making changes.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:10.815
Maybe they're making changes in different parts of

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:14.655
the files, but if you notice, both Nick

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:16.495
and Tony have made changes in the same

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:19.535
file. And then in order to merge those

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:21.440
changes together, one of them has to do

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440
the hard work of copying over the changes

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.560
one by one, and that's really sad. So

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.680
an hour of copying and pasting later, after

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.895
making 10 gazillion changes to this file, Tony

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.535
realizes, oh, crap. I just needed those lines

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:39.495
that we just deleted. And so when I

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:43.335
see this slide, I imagine, like, the, like,

00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:45.815
suspenseful movie music playing and everyone, like, typing

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:47.550
furiously on their computers. Computers. But let's just

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.110
say, okay, for the sake of example, that

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.870
Nick and Tony are just really good at

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.270
collaborating. Nick is a beast with a copy

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.550
and paste. They're so good at communication. But

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.455
then I come in. I'm like, hey, guys.

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:02.215
What you doing? Can I join? Can I

00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:04.215
help you guys? And then I don't know

00:04:04.215 --> 00:04:08.615
what the heck is going on. So to

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.455
summarize the problems that we just described, there's

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:13.910
a few things that we need in order

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.790
to collaborate on code. One, what makes this

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.390
different from document editing is that we need

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.790
independent local copies of the code base. So

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.470
I can work on stuff on my computer

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.830
without breaking anybody else's code. We also need

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.805
to be able to merge the changes that

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:29.645
I'm making with the changes that someone else

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:32.525
is making pretty seamlessly. We need to be

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:33.965
able to keep track of versions, so if

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:36.045
I realize that I broke something and I

00:04:36.045 --> 00:04:38.045
don't know what the crap just happened to

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:39.965
what what I just did to my code,

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:42.620
I can roll it back. And we need

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.380
to know, obviously, which version is the most

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.580
up to date. So we could think about

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.340
all these problems and do all of this

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.220
ourselves, but thankfully, really smart people have already

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.060
thought about this and solved it all for

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.725
us and they made Git. So what is

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.845
Git exactly? At a core level, it basically

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:03.565
just tracks changes in files using some fancy

00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:07.005
math. So if I'm editing a file, I

00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:08.925
type in, like corgis, at the bottom of

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.670
this doc, and I delete the line and

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.710
about cats, then the core functionality of git

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.190
is just keeping track of these changes that

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.550
I made. So this information that I added

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.030
this and deleted that is what git stores.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.615
Oops. Oh, yes. We are gonna see an

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:29.695
example. Okay. So before we go on any

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.935
further and explain what's going on, we're going

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:33.935
to I'm gonna show you how to create

00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:36.255
a Git repo and also show you a

00:05:36.255 --> 00:05:40.860
few basic terminal commands in the process. So

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.820
if you have done the homework zero setup,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.060
then you will have git installed on your

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.660
machine. It should be already if you have

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.940
a Mac, but if you have a Windows,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.740
you might need to install git bash. So

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.220
I'm gonna open up my Versus code, and

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.765
I have a folder called web lab that

00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:56.965
I'm gonna put all of my web lab

00:05:56.965 --> 00:06:01.525
stuff in. And here, if I go to

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:04.005
terminal and then new terminal, then I can

00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:06.245
open up this guy. If you're on Windows,

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:07.845
then you might need to hit the plus

00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.525
down arrow button in order to get the

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:11.410
terminal here to be git bash and not,

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.090
like, something silly like command prompt. Or you

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.730
can also, alternatively, open up the terminal or

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.570
git bash in your, like, just in your

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.185
computer as a whole. This and this are

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:26.185
the same thing. Since I'm on Windows, I'm

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.945
using Git Bash, but if you're on Mac,

00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:30.505
you would just use terminal. And the terminal

00:06:30.505 --> 00:06:32.025
is basically just a way for us to

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.185
interact with our computer. So I can interact

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.945
with my computer by clicking and dragging things

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:39.060
if by going to file explorer or finder.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.420
And this is just insanely more powerful way

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.900
of doing that. So some basic terminal commands

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.465
you'll probably need are l s, which means

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:52.545
list. So it's just going to list out

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.945
everything that I have in the directory or

00:06:54.945 --> 00:06:59.585
folder that I'm currently in. Another command you'll

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.665
need is c d. So that stands for

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:04.305
change directory. So let's say I wanna go

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.970
into my catbook react directory. You'll see what

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.850
that is later. Then I go inside, and

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.090
now you'll notice that I'm inside my catbook

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.250
react directory. And if I l s, I

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.995
can see everything that's inside of there. Now

00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:19.915
let's say I wanna go back out of

00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:22.715
Catbook React, back into my web lab folder,

00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:24.155
I'll do c d dot dot, and that

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:26.155
just stands for the directory that's one directory

00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:31.355
back from where I currently am. Okay. Feel

00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:32.580
free to follow along, but you don't have

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.700
to. I'll give you time to try it

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.180
out on your own. And then another command

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.500
that I'll use is make directory, m k

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.420
d I r, and that will create a

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.100
new folder. So I'm gonna create a new

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.355
folder called git demo for this lecture's purposes.

00:07:50.635 --> 00:07:53.755
And I hate these Zoom floating meeting controls.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:59.675
Alright. And so now that I have this

00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:01.115
new folder, I'm going to go into it,

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:04.550
c d into git demo, and issue this

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.950
command called git init. And that just creates

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.310
a new git repository within that folder that

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.710
I'm currently in. So now, we have this

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.285
file called dot git, and dot git is

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:18.485
the file that we don't need to worry

00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:20.725
about, but git uses in order to track

00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:23.045
all of the changes to any files within

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.285
my git demo folder. And so now, my

00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:29.270
git demo folder is a git repository. Cool.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.350
Alright. So now I'm gonna give you guys

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.310
a chance to try that yourselves. So I'll

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.710
give you, like, two minutes to try creating

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.870
a new directory, c d ing into it,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.685
calling git init. I'll give you, like, one

00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:43.045
minute and then we'll see where people are

00:08:43.045 --> 00:09:07.970
at. I need my phone to time. And

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.450
if you're having any technical issues, feel free

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.275
to add yourself to weblab.is/q and a staff

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:15.115
member will come help you. You're free to

00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:16.795
add yourself to the queue even while I'm

00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:21.115
yapping, and people can come help you. And

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:22.475
let me know if you have any questions.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.240
Alright. If you think you need more time,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.785
please hold up a finger, one, two, three,

00:10:07.785 --> 00:10:09.785
four, etcetera, for how many more minutes you

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:14.825
think you need. Okay. We've got a few

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:17.945
people. I'll give you guys a little bit

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:35.335
more time. Alright. If you're having trouble I'm

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:36.775
gonna move on. But if you're having trouble

00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:38.695
and you need a reference, the commands to

00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:40.695
run, you can either look on with someone

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:44.375
nearby, or if you go to weblab.is/schedule, all

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:46.695
of the slides are linked there. So if

00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:49.560
you just go to weblab.is/schedule, find my lecture,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.040
git basics, click on the Google Docs, Google

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.640
Slides link, then you should be able to

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.560
pull up the slides and reference anything that

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.800
you might be behind on. Okay. So now

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.640
we're gonna talk about what we actually, as

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.705
programmers, do with git. And that is make

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.745
changes to our code, because we're productive programmers.

00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:12.145
So the basic idea of Git is that

00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:14.225
it keeps track of a history of all

00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:15.600
of the changes that we've made to our

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.080
code, and the individual sort of units of

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.440
changes that we make are called commits. And

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.760
it's almost like they're it's a package set

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.320
of code changes. What do I mean by

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.315
that? Well, let's say we're making we're here,

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:33.155
and we're editing a bunch of our files.

00:11:33.475 --> 00:11:35.795
We delete the line, I like cats, from

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.715
one file, we add the line, I like

00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:40.755
corgis, to another file, add more lines, make

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:45.640
more code changes, etcetera. And then once we're

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.520
ready to sort of package those changes up,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.280
then and add it to our commit history,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.520
then we have something called the staging area.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.000
And this is basically where we put all

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.645
of the code changes that we're going to

00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:03.165
want to package up into our commit. So

00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:05.165
the command we use is called git add,

00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:06.285
and then we put in the name of

00:12:06.285 --> 00:12:08.045
the file. So let's say we do git

00:12:08.045 --> 00:12:10.720
add woof dot py. That will add all

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.040
of the changes we've made to woof dot

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.120
py to the staging area. And then if

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.120
we add cats dot py as well, then

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.040
we're adding the change we made there also

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.200
to the staging area. And once we're ready

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.405
to commit, we do git commit dash m

00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:27.325
with a message that describes what that commit

00:12:27.325 --> 00:12:30.125
is. Oops, that slide is not right. There

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.965
should be the cats thing in there too.

00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:34.605
And let's say we call it dogs and

00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:37.370
cats. And then what that does is it

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.810
takes all those changes that were in the

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.690
staging area, boxes them up, slaps on a

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.330
label that says what the changes are about,

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.490
and adds it to our commit history. And

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.005
so then, the staging area is refreshed and

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.605
there's a new box and we can do

00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:55.365
git add more to add to our next

00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:58.405
commit. Okay. So I'm going to demo what

00:12:58.405 --> 00:13:01.125
that looks like in our Versus code, and

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:02.805
why do I keep having the floating meeting

00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:09.540
controls? Oh my gosh. Okay. So we have

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.940
our git demo folder, and let's make some

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.980
changes. I am going to add a new

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.155
file, and I'm going to call it abby

00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:22.235
dot t x t. And I am not

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:24.955
going to use Copilot to write something. I'm

00:13:24.955 --> 00:13:29.435
gonna say, Abby likes cats. I'll just type

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:32.430
that. And then I'm gonna use a command

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.990
called git status to just see where I

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.550
am, and it tells me that I'm I

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.270
don't have any commits yet, and there's one

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.350
file that they call untracked that has not

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.870
been added to the staging area, so that's

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.035
why it's red. Git recorded that I made

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.475
this change, but it's not in the staging

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:50.235
area yet, so I'm gonna add it. So

00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:52.155
I'm gonna say git add, and then abby

00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:55.035
dot txt. And now, if I do git

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:58.075
status, I can see that it says, changes

00:13:58.075 --> 00:14:00.600
to be committed, new file abby dot t

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.840
x t. So that means that git says

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.560
that this file is in my staging area.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.480
And if I wanna commit it, then I

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.600
can do git commit m abby, or whatever

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.840
I wanna call it, and it created my

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.955
commit. And now I can run a command

00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:18.155
called git log, and git log just tells

00:14:18.155 --> 00:14:21.195
me all of the oh, sorry, all of

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:22.955
the commits that I have in my history.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.995
So when I say git log, now there's

00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:28.155
one commit that I just made in my

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:30.950
log. And if I want to make more

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.190
changes, make more commits, then those commits will

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.550
show up in my commit log. So now

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.070
I'm gonna give you guys a chance to

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.475
try that in your own repos. So I'll

00:14:42.475 --> 00:14:44.155
give you, like, two to three minutes to

00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:46.235
play around with it, make as many changes,

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:48.475
make as many commits as you want. And

00:14:48.475 --> 00:14:50.715
again, if you have any questions, let me

00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:58.510
know or add yourself to the queue. Also,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.030
Zoom people, you can also add yourself to

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.230
the queue. You can just put a Zoom

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.110
link for, like, your own Zoom room if

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:29.340
you need technical help. How's it going over

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.660
here? Any questions? Oh, wait. I need to

00:15:31.660 --> 00:16:15.105
turn this off. Alright. Same as before. Give

00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:17.905
me a one, two, three, four, etcetera fingers

00:16:17.905 --> 00:16:21.170
if you need more time. Cool. I see

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.010
a lot of hands. So I will give

00:16:23.010 --> 00:17:28.105
you guys a couple more minutes. Alright. Hopefully,

00:17:28.105 --> 00:17:32.025
was enough time. We're going to move on.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.810
Okay. So in git, once we've made our

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.250
commits and everything, in the previous slide, we

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.570
were showing commits as a package set of

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.965
code changes and we were using these little

00:17:53.965 --> 00:17:57.165
package things with the labels as our picture.

00:17:57.485 --> 00:18:00.765
But in typical, like, whenever you If you

00:18:00.765 --> 00:18:02.925
look up anything about git, they will typically

00:18:02.925 --> 00:18:04.525
use graphs that look a little bit more

00:18:04.525 --> 00:18:08.540
like this. And these are, basically, each circle

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.260
just represents a commit. And each circle, each

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.820
commit has a unique ID, which is going

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.460
to be, if we look in our git

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.665
log, you'll notice that there's the commit message

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:25.185
here, but there's also this gigantic, redonkulous looking

00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:28.225
string. And that's the ID for our commit.

00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:29.985
So any time in git, if we want

00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:32.305
to do something and refer to that particular

00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:34.065
commit that we made, then we're going to

00:18:34.065 --> 00:18:37.700
use this ID. And so this slide is

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.740
just to familiarize you with the notion of

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.460
having these graphs where each circle represents a

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.220
commit. And so this represents the history of

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.700
all of the sets of changes that we've

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:56.595
made. Okay. So now consider the following. We

00:18:56.595 --> 00:18:58.675
have a scenario. Tony is working on his

00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:01.635
new and improved homepage to his website, and

00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:04.510
then Andrew comes along. Andrew was one of

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.070
our staff last year. And he's like, can

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.350
you help me fix this bug on the

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.030
home page? And Tony's like, I got you,

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.950
bro. And then Abby comes in and she

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.535
goes, Tony, we need a WebLab Tinder feature

00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:20.375
to be added to our website tomorrow, and

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:23.415
you need to do it right now. And

00:19:23.415 --> 00:19:25.735
so now Tony's a little bit confused, because

00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:27.815
he was working on his home page. He

00:19:27.815 --> 00:19:29.575
was trying to make a new version of

00:19:29.575 --> 00:19:31.680
the home page, and so he was changing

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.760
a ton of stuff in the code, deleting

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.320
stuff, adding things. And then Andrew comes along

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.160
and he's like, can you help me fix

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
this bug on the original home page? So

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.880
now Tony has to somehow go back to

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.560
the code on the original home page in

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.045
order to fix the bug on that. And

00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:49.045
then Abby comes along and is like, we

00:19:49.045 --> 00:19:51.045
need you to work on this. And then

00:19:51.045 --> 00:19:53.525
he somehow has to revert again in order

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.925
to work off of the original working code

00:19:55.925 --> 00:19:58.405
to make this new WebLab Tinder feature. It's

00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.845
kind of It would be kind of a

00:19:59.845 --> 00:20:04.780
mess. And that's where git branching comes in.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.140
So basically, what we can do is, earlier

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.140
I mentioned how each of these circles represents

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.020
a commit, and it represents a series of,

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.345
like, packaged code changes. But if each circle

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:18.185
represents a series of packaged code changes, then

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:21.065
it kind of also represents a version of

00:20:21.065 --> 00:20:22.825
our code, like a snapshot of what our

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:24.425
code looks like at any one point in

00:20:24.425 --> 00:20:28.200
time. So you can think of this as

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.520
the version of the code after we've made

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.280
this set of changes. And so if we

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.600
want So in order for Tony to work

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.680
on all of these different things, kind of

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.765
simultaneously, then he can branch off. So let's

00:20:42.765 --> 00:20:46.365
say that this is the last working version

00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:47.965
of our home page, that's the standard one

00:20:47.965 --> 00:20:51.325
that everyone's using right now. Then he's branching

00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:53.990
off from that and making changes to make

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.590
his new home page, but when he wants

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.590
to fix this bug for Andrew, he's gonna

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.270
go back to the last working version of

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.750
the home page in git, and then start

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.670
making new changes for his bug fix for

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.835
Andrew. Then he can go back again and

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:10.235
make new changes off of that for WebLab

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:14.155
Tinder. And so the benefit of branching is

00:21:14.155 --> 00:21:15.995
just that he can make all of these

00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:18.715
changes, and Git will remember that he's made

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:20.150
all of these changes to the home page.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.070
So once he's finished WebLab Tinder and this

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.670
bug fix, then he can go back and

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.830
just keep working where he left off on

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.870
this branch. So now I'm going to demo

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.270
how to create a new branch in Git.

00:21:39.175 --> 00:21:43.575
Okay. So we have our there's a command

00:21:43.575 --> 00:21:46.295
called git checkout, and git checkout, the purpose

00:21:46.295 --> 00:21:48.455
of it is to switch from one branch

00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:50.890
to another. If I do git branch, then

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.330
I can see all of the branches that

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.010
I have. Right now, there's only one, that's

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.650
main. But if I do git checkout dash

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.050
b, dash b says create a new branch,

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.015
I'm gonna call it cat, I don't know.

00:22:06.095 --> 00:22:07.935
Now, I created a new branch and I

00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:09.215
switched to it. So if I do git

00:22:09.215 --> 00:22:13.855
branch again, then I can see that there

00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:15.375
is the main branch, and now there's a

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.975
cat branch, and the current branch I'm on

00:22:16.975 --> 00:22:19.430
is the cat branch. And so let's say

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:25.430
I'm going to make some more changes to

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.230
my file, and I'm going to do git

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.790
status, check out, yep, git notices that I

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.475
made those changes. I'm going to add abby.txt

00:22:34.475 --> 00:22:36.795
to add that change to my staging area.

00:22:37.115 --> 00:22:38.235
So now you can see it's in the

00:22:38.235 --> 00:22:44.155
staging area. I'm gonna commit lots of cats.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.440
And so now, if you think in your

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.840
head about what the object diagraph, what the

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.440
git graph for this is going to look

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.280
like, if I git log here, I see

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.520
both my original change that was on my

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.715
original branch, and then the new change that

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:05.115
I just made on my new branch. But

00:23:05.115 --> 00:23:06.715
if I go back, if I git checkout

00:23:06.715 --> 00:23:12.075
back to main, and then I git log

00:23:12.075 --> 00:23:15.210
here, then I only see the original branch.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.490
And so my object graph looks something a

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.890
little bit like this. Where I have my

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.890
original commit on the main branch, and then

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.675
this is my cat branch, and then I

00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:30.275
have a new commit on my cat branch.

00:23:33.075 --> 00:23:36.035
Okay. Same as before, gonna give you a

00:23:36.035 --> 00:23:38.915
chance to try it out yourselves. Add yourself

00:23:38.915 --> 00:23:47.440
to the queue if you get stuck. Actually,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.800
before I go on, does anyone have any

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.280
questions or confusions about what I was just

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.875
talking about? I can't tell if the silence

00:23:55.875 --> 00:23:57.715
means that y'all are all confused or y'all

00:23:57.715 --> 00:27:52.730
are all good and just, like, working. Alright.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.410
If you got lost or confused, feel free

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:57.930
to add yourself to the queue and one

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.690
of our amazing staff members could help you.

00:27:59.965 --> 00:28:02.285
Even while I'm yapping, you can ask the

00:28:02.285 --> 00:28:06.125
other staff for help. And also, if you

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:10.045
got completely lost and don't know where we're

00:28:10.045 --> 00:28:13.725
going now, please do not stress out. You'll

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:16.880
be fine. And we can get you caught

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.120
up on whatever you got confused on, either

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.600
after lecture or at office hours, or you

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.520
can your friends can help you as well.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.915
So unfortunately, I have to keep us moving

00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:31.115
along. So what is happening in the object

00:28:31.115 --> 00:28:35.275
graph when we create a branch? Well, whichever

00:28:35.275 --> 00:28:37.035
commit we were on when we created our

00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:38.795
branch, that's gonna be the one we're branching

00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:40.875
off from. So I can create new commands

00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:42.715
in the WebLab Tinder branch, I can commit

00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:44.210
or I can switch back to the main

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:48.530
branch and create new commits there. And then

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.210
let's say that I was working, or Tony

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.050
was working on the WebLab Tinder branch and

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.695
he was making his commits, And then someone

00:28:56.695 --> 00:28:58.215
else was working on the main branch, and

00:28:58.215 --> 00:28:59.815
they were fixing some bugs or something like

00:28:59.815 --> 00:29:01.815
that. And now we wanna put these commits

00:29:01.815 --> 00:29:05.015
back together and merge WebLab Tinder and bring

00:29:05.015 --> 00:29:07.735
all of those changes into main. How do

00:29:07.735 --> 00:29:14.250
we do that? That's something called merging. So

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.930
basically, if I want to merge all my

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.970
commits from my cat's branch into my main

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:29.145
branch, then I hate this Zoom thing. Then

00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:31.145
let's see. So right now, I'm on main.

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:36.105
If I were on what did I call

00:29:36.105 --> 00:29:39.710
my branch? Cat? I'll do git branch to

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.070
see. I called it cat. So if I

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.910
check out cat and I'm on cat, then

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.550
I can't merge cat into main. I need

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.390
to be on main in order to merge

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.275
cat back in. So I'll check out main.

00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:55.835
And you'll notice that when I check out

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:59.115
different branches, the version of the code in

00:29:59.115 --> 00:30:01.995
my Versus Code window will change based on

00:30:01.995 --> 00:30:05.035
whatever the most recent commit in that particular

00:30:05.035 --> 00:30:08.770
branch is. So now, all I can do

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.050
is all I have to do is you

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.570
git merge cat, and that will merge the

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.890
changes from cat into main. And so now

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.650
you'll notice that I'm in main, but I

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.170
have all the changes that I made on

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.025
the cat branch. And then typically, practice is

00:30:23.025 --> 00:30:27.745
just shut up. Good practice is to delete

00:30:28.865 --> 00:30:34.590
the branch that I was on before, now

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.790
that I'm done with it, now that all

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.590
the changes have been merged into main. Alright.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.150
Same as before? Oh, wait. Sorry. I am

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.795
not going to okay. I'm not gonna give

00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:49.155
you time to work on that yourselves because

00:30:49.155 --> 00:30:50.675
it's pretty quick, and we're going to actually

00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:53.795
go into more detail on merging in the

00:30:53.795 --> 00:30:55.555
second git lecture that we have at the

00:30:55.555 --> 00:31:00.670
end of this week. Okay. So when we

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.390
put them back together, the object graph looks

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.110
something like this. It's not quite the same

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.470
as this. We'll go into more detail on

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.230
that later. But then the question that we

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.635
have finally is, well, how does collaboration work

00:31:14.635 --> 00:31:16.315
then? Because we did all of this stuff

00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:20.875
with Git, branching, creating new Git repos, creating

00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:24.075
commits, etcetera, but all of that was locally

00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:25.915
on our own computer. How are we supposed

00:31:25.915 --> 00:31:28.075
to share this and collaborate with other people?

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.050
And that's where a server such as GitHub

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.330
comes in. So GitHub is just a giant

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.210
server somewhere that hosts all of our code.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.490
And so there will now be a version

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:42.850
How this works is there will now be

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.515
a version of our code on GitHub, a

00:31:45.515 --> 00:31:47.915
version of our code on our own computers,

00:31:47.915 --> 00:31:50.395
and the computers of whoever we're collaborating with.

00:31:51.915 --> 00:31:57.210
And so this introduces interesting complexity because now

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.010
we have another independent local copy of our

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.890
code on GitHub. So let's say that Nick

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.650
is working, and there's a copy of his

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.810
code on his computer, and the GitHub is

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.210
updated with what he's got on his computer.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.995
And now Tony wants to join in. He's

00:32:11.995 --> 00:32:14.235
going to do git clone on the repo

00:32:14.235 --> 00:32:15.675
in GitHub, and we'll show you how to

00:32:15.675 --> 00:32:18.635
do that pretty soon. So he's gonna git

00:32:18.635 --> 00:32:20.955
clone that, and now there's a copy of

00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:22.715
the object graph, like all the commits that

00:32:22.715 --> 00:32:25.050
have been made, the full history, and all

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.970
of the files, of course, on his computer

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.090
that exactly matches everything else. Now if Tony

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.890
wants to make some commands, some commits, sorry,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.770
some changes, he'll make his commit, and then

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.515
he'll use a command called git push to

00:32:38.515 --> 00:32:42.115
update whatever GitHub has with whatever he has,

00:32:42.115 --> 00:32:45.795
with the commits that he just made. And

00:32:45.795 --> 00:32:49.315
if Nick wants to take the commit that

00:32:49.315 --> 00:32:52.930
Tony just pushed onto the remote server and

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.730
bring it onto his local development environment, he'll

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.530
use the command git fetch, and that basically

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.410
just looks and updates whatever he's got on

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.555
his computer with whatever was added to the

00:33:07.555 --> 00:33:09.955
remote server. But then he can do something

00:33:09.955 --> 00:33:12.275
called git pull, and how that's different from

00:33:12.275 --> 00:33:15.715
git fetch is that git pull actually merges

00:33:15.715 --> 00:33:18.035
the command, the commits from the remote server

00:33:18.035 --> 00:33:20.950
into what he has locally. So if he

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.350
does git pull, then it will actually update

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.670
his Versus code with the commit that Tony

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:31.350
had made. So the basic commands that you

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.565
need to know are git clone to take

00:33:34.565 --> 00:33:36.725
a repo and bring it onto your computer,

00:33:36.965 --> 00:33:38.725
and then you can make your commits, and

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:41.285
then you push, git push, to bring those

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:43.045
commands to update the remote server with those

00:33:43.045 --> 00:33:45.700
commits that you made. And then git pull

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.020
to pull those commits that other people have

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.740
made and put onto GitHub onto your local

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.220
computer, your local development environment. And then another

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.500
command that we'll be using a lot in

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.535
web lab workshops, which you actually should never

00:33:58.535 --> 00:34:00.775
use in practice, but for our jank web

00:34:00.775 --> 00:34:03.335
lab workshop development setup, we use this. It's

00:34:03.335 --> 00:34:05.335
called git reset dash dash hard. There should

00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:08.135
be two dashes there. And that wipes all

00:34:08.135 --> 00:34:11.815
of the uncommitted, unstaged local changes that you've

00:34:11.815 --> 00:34:13.750
made. So if you were coding and then

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:14.870
you were like, oh, shoot, I don't wanna

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.630
do that, you do git reset dash dash

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.070
hard and that just wipes everything except what

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:25.925
has been committed already. Okay. That was it

00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:29.845
for git. Please, everyone, stand up. It's been

00:34:29.845 --> 00:34:32.085
a long time of sitting. Get a good

00:34:32.085 --> 00:34:36.325
stretch. And go to weblab.is/feedback to give me

00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:38.170
feedback on that lecture that I just gave.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.730
It's, like, super quick. It'll take thirty seconds.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.930
And we'll be doing this after every single

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:45.610
lecture so that we can get good data

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.690
on what you guys liked and what you
