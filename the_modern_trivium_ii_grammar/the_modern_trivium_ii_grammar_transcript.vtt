00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.320
Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.720
the Modern Trivium part two in which I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.120
get down to the details. Last time I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080
went through sort of the historical and philosophical

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.720
background to frame this series of lectures. This

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.015
time let's get down to it but just

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:19.975
again a quick note summary summary from the

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.855
last one is the goal of a classical

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:27.735
education was to give people the power to

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.720
express themselves themselves and to achieve what they

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.640
wanted to achieve in the world. And so,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.880
you need to understand yourself and understand the

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.280
world to be able to do that and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.200
then to have the skills necessary to pursue

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.360
your goals. And so, keep this in mind

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.785
because this is sort of the core of

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:48.265
this. Powerful people gaining the skills necessary to

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:52.905
be able to achieve their ends. So, trivium,

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:56.425
the actual trivium, was in three parts, hence

00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:01.540
trivium, of course. One, grammar. Two, logic. Three,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.300
rhetoric. So, I'll take each of those in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.540
turn, those will each be a lecture coming

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.140
up, then we'll look at the quadrivium and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.980
some other issues later on. So, first, trivium

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.595
part one, grammar. Now, grammar is simple in

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:18.875
concept, again, a little hard for us to

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.035
grasp what they actually meant by this and

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:22.875
how it was executed in the ancient world,

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.795
so I'll spend some time looking at that.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:29.850
Fundamentally, this is about writing and reading. And

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.170
so, again, in the ancient world, literacy was

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.050
quite rare and so being able to not

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.250
just write but write well and not be

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.615
able to just read but read well. These

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:46.215
were extraordinarily rare achievements. Less than ten percent

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:48.695
of the population, certainly way less is probably

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:51.095
going to be literate at any level and

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:53.780
to be really highly literate in the way

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.820
that they were striving for with the Trivium,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.860
you know, is a tiny handful of people.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.860
So, was something that would really set you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.845
apart. Curiously, in the modern world, literacy is,

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:11.405
in theory, no longer that rare. However, functionally,

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:13.645
to be literate in the way they were

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.765
talking about is still quite rare, which I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.270
want to talk about and one of the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.150
reasons that I wanted to do this series.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.310
I've always talked about when I was teaching

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.510
writing and teaching composition at the college that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.505
the function of learning to write, of which

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.185
reading is a part hard to write without

00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:36.905
being able to read, of course, was to

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:39.465
be able to express yourself in a way

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.905
that writing was never a barrier to you.

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:44.745
Right? Like that you had the skills, so

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.140
whatever you wanted to do, your writing would

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.300
not prevent you from doing that. And people

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.260
go, Okay, yeah, sure, whatever, but, ah, I

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.420
mean, grammatical and writing skills necessary to do

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.180
that are actually a challenge to acquire, don't

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.615
come naturally. And in case I ever doubted

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:06.175
this, which I didn't, having moved to France

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:10.575
and having literacy in French roughly equivalent to

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:14.415
a not terribly bright Golden Retriever, I can

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:19.030
assure you that not having language and really

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.830
not having a very full grasp of language

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.670
presents a barrier, many barriers, to trying to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.335
achieve the goals that you have the capacities,

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:33.975
you feel that inside you have the capacities,

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:37.335
but you don't have the literacy, the grammatical

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.375
skills necessary to express that in the world.

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:43.175
I'm sure anybody else who's been an immigrant

00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:46.310
has felt this very powerfully. You see doors

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.750
closed, see opportunities shut down, you feel you

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.390
want to express things that you just can't

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.390
in a language that's not your native language

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.790
or another language that you have a very

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.485
strong grasp of. And so the purpose of

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:04.805
this is to, of acquiring a high level

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:07.525
of reading and writing, is so that there

00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:09.685
is no barrier or, you know, as few

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:12.590
as possible that you might encounter in doing

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.470
whatever it is you want to do. And

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.550
just to give you a sense of how

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.510
powerful this is, again, that this is confusing,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.310
I would imagine, people, but, you know, the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.630
levels of literacy also matter. This is the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.455
other thing, we pretend like it doesn't and

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:29.615
I've had many many of my students over

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:33.615
the years who have been very poorly educated,

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:37.535
their writing skills were just incredibly poor. It's

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.215
not their fault, they just didn't write a

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:41.535
lot and when they did write, they were

00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:45.840
not given appropriate instruction in fundamentals of how

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.800
to write the English language. And what this

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.720
meant was, is that whoever was teaching them

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.120
probably know themselves, and two, it just made

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.235
it a lot easier for them to go,

00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:55.595
Oh yeah, you're fine. Oh yeah, you're fine.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.115
Everybody says, Oh yeah, you're fine, then you

00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:59.675
pass. But if you look around at the

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.915
world, if you look at people in important

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:04.475
positions of power, if you look at people

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:05.915
in the media, if we take them as

00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:08.635
sort of a bar in some ways, what

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:10.270
you'll see, and this weird in The United

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.670
States, people rarely comment on this, but it's

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.550
very strange, they speak a very uniform kind

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.950
of English, and to the level that you

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.915
can ever see their writing but it is

00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:29.355
this very uniform kind of standardized American English

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:35.275
that is easily recognizable. And now what's odd

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.650
about this is in a country of tens

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.250
of millions of immigrants, you rarely see people

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.850
on the news or interviewing people or being

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.850
interviewed in the media anywhere who have strong

00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:51.815
accents. They're perfectly clear, perfectly literate, can speak

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:54.055
perfectly well, but they have, you know, very

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:59.655
strong Chinese or Hispanic or Portuguese or, I

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:07.000
mean, any kind of accent. Like, amazingly uniform.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.080
And so, for instance, even you don't hear

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.880
strong regional accents, you don't hear strong accents

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.800
from the South, because culturally, Southern accents are

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.235
associated with people being dumb, essentially, in The

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:25.195
United States. Completely inaccurate, of course, it's a

00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:26.875
silly thing, but it is an accent, and

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.955
so people tend to train themselves out of

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:31.835
that. Unless, by the way, they want to

00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:33.760
do something where they want to present themselves

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.160
as authentic, and then they'll tend to exaggerate

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.960
or make an accent thicker. You can see

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.080
people working with this. But, by and large,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.400
there's this incredibly uniform way of speaking and

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.125
writing that gives you access to all kinds

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:57.005
of different positions, positions of power that might

00:06:57.005 --> 00:07:00.445
be desirable for people. And it's okay if

00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:02.140
you don't want those positions, don't want to

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.300
do that, that's great. It's just that this

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.500
is what they were talking about in the

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.900
ancient world, they weren't confused about this. We

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.500
tend to pretend like this is not the

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.540
case now. And it's like, whether it's right

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.740
or wrong, I mean, I would argue that

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.420
this is not a very good system, but

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.225
it is the system and one needs to

00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:20.505
understand that and recognize that fully. A last

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:22.825
example of this, by the way, you know,

00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:24.585
I'm a huge fan of the NFL, one

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:28.425
of my addictions, and the announcers for the

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:33.100
NFL also tend to have very uniform, middle

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.660
of the road, middle class white accents in

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.780
a game which is not dominated by those

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.420
people. So, you look at the broadcasters who

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.135
come in, if you look at the people

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:47.135
who call the games of this, and a

00:07:47.135 --> 00:07:48.895
couple of years ago, they got a defensive

00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:51.935
back and I cannot remember his name. And

00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:54.335
African American, he had a different pattern of

00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:57.530
speech, I think he was from Texas, but

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.450
he just had this very different pattern. I

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.650
thought, Oh, how refreshing, someone who speaks in

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.730
a mode similar to the way a lot

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.090
of the players speak, a lot of the

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.170
Southern White players speak, lot of the just

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.265
sounded more like players than it did like

00:08:12.265 --> 00:08:15.145
all of the other people who are speaking.

00:08:15.705 --> 00:08:17.705
And so, I thought, wow, there it is,

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:22.985
right? The language issues are always there. Just

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:26.070
don't let anybody fool you on this, right?

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.990
Language matters, how you deploy language matters. I

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.510
don't make the rules, I'm not saying this

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.270
is a great system, I'm just saying this

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.630
is a system and this is what they

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.950
were talking about in the ancient world and

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.270
that's what we're talking about today. If you

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.315
have sufficiently high levels of reading and writing,

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:44.395
so that it's never a barrier to what

00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:47.515
you want to do, then great, this is

00:08:47.515 --> 00:08:49.355
what you want to achieve, is where you

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:51.755
want to be. Now, I wish I could

00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:54.290
do a full writing class with difficult to

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.930
do in this environment, of course, but I

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.650
can give you a very simple set of

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.490
guidelines that will help you. And the basic

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.450
rule is, if you can write a single

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.415
spaced page and make one grammatical error or

00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:13.055
one spelling error or something like this, no

00:09:13.055 --> 00:09:14.655
one is ever going to bother you. Your

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:18.255
writing is fine. Like, this is the thing.

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:21.535
If can do it, be coherent, write, you

00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:24.430
know, 300 to 500 words, maybe, depending on

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.110
the page, right, pages, how long is a

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.990
page, and you make a grammatical error, no

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.910
one who reads a resume, no one who

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.110
reads a scholarship application, just in an email

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.470
professionally, you're going to be fine, assuming you're

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.905
not not a copy editor, right? If you're

00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:41.065
a copy editor, this is a different subject.

00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:45.705
But for the written language in English, that

00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:48.025
is what you want to shoot for. If

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:50.910
you can achieve that as like a rough

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.750
bar, you'll be fine. And best way to

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.550
go about doing that is to write very

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.830
simple sentences. These are boring sentences, but they're

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.965
often clear And what happens, or has happened,

00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:06.165
or what I've seen with a lot of

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.565
my students over the years, is they've been

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:11.525
told that long, flowery sentences with lots of

00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:15.250
big words make you sound intelligent. They don't

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.330
make you sound intelligent, they give you the

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.290
opportunity to make a bunch of really obvious

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.930
and unfortunate grammatical errors, or word usage errors,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.505
that make it clear that you have absolutely

00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:30.545
no idea what you're doing. And it works

00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:32.705
to a certain point, as long as teachers

00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:35.665
and professors are simply going, Okay, you wrote

00:10:35.665 --> 00:10:37.745
some words on a page, have a B.

00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:39.985
They were long words and they were big

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:42.180
pages, have a B plus or have an

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.140
A, whatever the grade is. But, if when

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.300
you go to apply for a job or

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.980
you go to write anything professionally or when

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.940
the writing really starts to matter, that will

00:10:54.365 --> 00:11:00.685
instantly become a barrier and so having that

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:04.205
in your mind that simple clear error free

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:08.525
writing is what people look for as the

00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:11.870
sort of barrier to entry. That's like your

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.190
first barrier to entry. But if you can

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.230
write a page, only make about one error

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.710
or so, you're going to be fine in

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:25.115
virtually any professional environment. A second element of

00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:28.235
this is the keys to writing well are

00:11:28.235 --> 00:11:33.675
very simple. One, again, write simple sentences. Two,

00:11:33.995 --> 00:11:38.660
get help. Right? There's this notion of I

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.820
don't know, it's a romantic, perhaps, notion, probably

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.100
a bad use of the word romantic, that,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.020
oh, you sit in a room by yourself

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.260
and you just write beautiful things and the

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.095
first draft is gonna be clear and concise

00:11:52.095 --> 00:11:54.175
and it's gonna be great, then you hand

00:11:54.175 --> 00:11:55.775
that in, or you give it to your

00:11:55.775 --> 00:12:00.015
boss, whatever, this is great. No, no, this

00:12:00.015 --> 00:12:01.935
is not great, this is un great in

00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:04.655
every way. What you want to do is

00:12:04.735 --> 00:12:08.090
give yourself time to, one, have other people

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.170
help you with your writing, right? If you've

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.330
got a draft of something, have somebody else

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.130
read it. Then come back and go back

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.370
over that. You're responsible at the end of

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.050
the day, but it's always good to have

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.515
other people help you. Use reference works. They're

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:26.755
actually very sophisticated now, you know, over the

00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:30.035
years, the sophistication of grammar tools that help

00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:33.395
you as you're typing and writing, built into

00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:37.330
most word processors, they can also be very

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.170
helpful. And so, being able to use spell

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.890
checks, grammar checks, thesaurus, dictionary, have other people

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.690
help you out, this is a big way

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.065
to path to success. Practice, practice, practice and

00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:56.745
get help. Get practice, practice, get help, right?

00:12:56.745 --> 00:12:59.225
This is just, and pretty soon, it doesn't

00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:01.385
take that much practice and that much help,

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:04.110
but pretty soon, your writing will to a

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.670
level where really don't have to worry about

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.990
it too much. But always keep in mind

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.110
that one reason writing was considered such an

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.350
achievement in the ancient world, and to a

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.990
certain extent, as I mentioned, still works as

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.825
a sorting mechanism today, is because writing is

00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:23.785
extraordinarily difficult. In fact, it is sort of

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:27.865
what the Trivian was developed to address. Because

00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.465
to write well, you not only have to

00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:33.800
get the grammatical elements right, sentence structure, word

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.080
usage, where to use a comma, these sorts

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.800
of things. You also have to have your

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.160
thinking be quite clear, that's a challenge. And

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.675
you have to have something something to say,

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.035
this is a challenge. So, getting your thinking

00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:51.635
organized and then writing a poor sentence, that

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:55.235
doesn't work. Having a clear sentence that has

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:57.235
no grammatical errors but has nothing to say

00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:59.075
or is not communicating your ideas because your

00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:01.390
ideas are confused, what you'll do is you'll

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.070
clearly express that you're confused. So that doesn't

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.270
work. Right? And if you don't have access

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.190
to the world, you don't have understanding of

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.110
yourself, then, ah, see, this this this is

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.735
why writing is such a vexatious and difficult

00:14:17.735 --> 00:14:21.255
skills. And somehow, I'm not sure what happened

00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:24.615
in this, we forgot this culturally, and we

00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:26.775
just want to pretend like everybody knows how

00:14:26.775 --> 00:14:29.255
to write, even though the quality of writing

00:14:29.255 --> 00:14:32.470
generally is incredibly poor. A little more about

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.830
why that matters at the end. So, step

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.230
one, or one aspect of this, is learning

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.350
to write well enough so that writing is

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.390
not a barrier to whatever it is you

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.655
want to achieve. If you can clear that

00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:51.255
hurdle, this is what the classics are about.

00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:54.215
Now you can do what you want because

00:14:54.215 --> 00:14:56.455
this is no longer a barrier for you.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.370
So, writing. And again, get help, give yourself

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.570
time to get help, write multiple drafts, keep

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.370
those sentences, know, Barzan again, who I'm always

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.290
talking about, has a book on writing, which

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.385
I highly recommend, called Simple Direct, and what

00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:15.345
she just says, you know, just write simple

00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:18.145
sentences and make them as direct as possible,

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:21.185
and you'll do pretty well. I mean, that's

00:15:21.185 --> 00:15:23.025
difficult, but that is it, you know, if

00:15:23.025 --> 00:15:25.105
you can do that, make them simple so

00:15:25.105 --> 00:15:27.760
you don't make medical and state clearly what

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.960
you mean, your writing will improve dramatically. So,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.560
part of this, or the second primary aspect

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.880
of the trivium, part one, grammar, was reading.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.295
And this is another skill that we sort

00:15:43.295 --> 00:15:46.575
of have lost track of, because we've sort

00:15:46.575 --> 00:15:49.615
of, oh, everybody can read. Well, most people

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.575
can read, but reading at what level? Again,

00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:57.400
there's levels to this. And what the ancients

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.160
thought and this is sort of throughout not

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.200
just ancient Greece and Rome but also China,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.040
India, you see this all over the place

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.200
basically in any literate culture Persia they came

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.485
up with this idea that's just repeated everywhere,

00:16:11.965 --> 00:16:15.325
that you want to read well enough so

00:16:15.325 --> 00:16:19.485
that you can spend time in conversation with

00:16:19.485 --> 00:16:23.645
great minds and great works. This is the

00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:27.390
goal of reading. And we've moved so far

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.070
away from this that it's just hard to

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.310
imagine. But if you want to read well,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.430
it means to be able to spend time

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.230
with whatever classics it is that you have

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.555
decided you want to study. Study. So, what

00:16:43.555 --> 00:16:46.595
happens today, in contrast, is they say, Okay,

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:48.915
well here's a summary, like here's a fifteen

00:16:48.915 --> 00:16:53.955
minute overview of the Iliad. Now, this will

00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:56.080
give you the plot points of the Iliad,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.480
or this will give you the main concepts

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.040
that Heidegger is deploying in Being and Time,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.080
or, you know, what happens in Shakespeare's Richard

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.400
III, or, you know, whatever. It is simply

00:17:11.705 --> 00:17:14.105
nothing, right? To the ancient world, this is

00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:18.025
nothing. Any fool can read that and get

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:22.105
that. The idea, however, is to enter a

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:25.865
conversation with the mind that has produced these

00:17:25.865 --> 00:17:30.290
classics. So, you spend time with the Iliad,

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.250
not because there's clear moral guidelines in the

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.850
Iliad. People are always trying to say this

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.610
when they talk about the Oh, this was

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.490
the guide that everybody aspired to in the

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.285
ancient world. The problem is, if you read

00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:45.485
the Iliad, or the Odyssey, what you immediately

00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:48.605
realize is all these characters are deeply, deeply

00:17:48.605 --> 00:17:51.965
problematic. Basically, this is the core of the

00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:55.720
plot. There are no except perhaps Hector may

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.800
be the one character, or one of the

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.120
few characters in the Iliad who really is

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.200
doing the right thing all the time in

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.160
the right way. I mean, he is sort

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.920
of an admirable character, but no one really

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.080
talks about him. This is the interesting thing.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.855
But, you know, Paris, Achilles, Agamemnon, Nestor, Odysseus

00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:16.935
for god's sakes I mean Ajax like all

00:18:16.935 --> 00:18:22.455
these characters are troubling they're they've created problems

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:26.430
they're confusing, they're vexatious, what they do people

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.150
go: Oh, you should be like Achilles. People

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.990
who have never read the Iliad think you

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.830
should be like Achilles. Dylan, at one point,

00:18:34.965 --> 00:18:37.365
is dragging a dead body behind a chariot,

00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:40.325
which sort of violates all the principles of

00:18:40.325 --> 00:18:42.325
ancient Greece, and so they have to have

00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:46.165
this mourning about this. And so, yeah, it

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:50.005
is not a guideline, there's no clear, like,

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.470
you know, one or two sentence or one

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.790
character you're supposed to believe in, it's a

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.310
conversation that you live with. And so the

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.790
reason you learn to read well, and this

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.470
is the second part of this, is to

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.625
read classics that are worth doing that with.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:08.025
And there's all kinds of reasons to read,

00:19:08.025 --> 00:19:10.185
like read for pleasure, I'll read anything. I

00:19:10.185 --> 00:19:11.625
read the back of a cereal box, I

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:13.465
love to read. Probably read too much, it's

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:16.585
one of my problems. But the reason you

00:19:16.585 --> 00:19:18.985
read classics, and the reason you read classics

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.510
in this particular way is because it expands

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.630
your mind, it expands your world. It is

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.390
an opportunity to spend time with great minds

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.550
who are exploring great characters or great philosophical

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.395
ideas or great historical moments, and this gives

00:19:37.395 --> 00:19:39.875
you more insight into the world, gives you

00:19:39.875 --> 00:19:44.595
more insight to yourself, and expands beyond any

00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:46.835
realm that you could get within your own

00:19:46.835 --> 00:19:50.790
culture, within your own time. And so, people

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.110
talk about this, and there's this whole concept

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.270
that's grown up, which I've talked about before,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.430
of, you know, Oh, we're just reading dead

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.870
white men. And it's like, Ah, yeah, but

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.630
why are we doing that? One, is it

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.685
true? No. Two, why might we be doing

00:20:05.685 --> 00:20:08.005
this? The quote unquote canon, by the way,

00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:10.565
which is never said. But you want to

00:20:10.565 --> 00:20:12.325
read dead people. It's not to say there's

00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:13.925
no living authors who are worth reading, there

00:20:13.925 --> 00:20:17.285
certainly are. But the reason it's better, in

00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:19.365
general, to read dead people is because you

00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:22.880
have time to sort, number one. So, if

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.440
a work has survived for several thousand years,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.080
part of this is pure happenstance and luck.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.080
But the other part of this is that

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.895
people have repeatedly selected to say: This work

00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:36.735
needs to be saved, this work needs to

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.335
be translated, this work needs to be kept

00:20:38.335 --> 00:20:40.255
in the museum, this work needs to be

00:20:40.655 --> 00:20:45.295
updated, continuously for a thousand years, two thousand

00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:49.280
years, a century. And what that means is,

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.600
this is like a vote of confidence, like

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.000
people over time saying, This has so much

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.520
value compared to everything else. 99% of stuff

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.520
is just crap or mediocre or not that

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.085
important. But this one, or these few works,

00:21:03.085 --> 00:21:06.205
really matter. So, this is one reason it's

00:21:06.205 --> 00:21:09.085
good to read dead people. Another reason is

00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:11.165
you want people who are outside of your

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:14.620
historical and cultural context. This is how you

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.100
expand your mind. The Classical Age Greeks did

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.340
not live in the world of the Iliad

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.740
or the Odyssey. This was not their world.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.495
They were looking back at a vanished world

00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:29.535
that did not share their outlook, that did

00:21:29.535 --> 00:21:32.975
not share their structure. This was a different

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:38.015
environment several hundred years earlier. And so, this

00:21:38.015 --> 00:21:39.855
was a way, again, of thinking about where

00:21:39.855 --> 00:21:41.900
they are, what their world was like, where

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.980
their world was going, by reflecting on the

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.260
past. So, when you read something from long

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.340
enough ago that the author is dead, or

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.420
maybe dead for a hundred years, or five

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.100
hundred, or a thousand, or two thousand, you're

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.055
reading something that has survived, which makes it

00:21:58.055 --> 00:22:01.655
probably a much better chance of being valuable,

00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:03.975
and two, something that can take you out

00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:06.295
of your own world, out of your own

00:22:06.295 --> 00:22:09.975
habits, out of your own thought assumptions. One

00:22:09.975 --> 00:22:11.980
of the great things about reading the classical

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.580
Chinese, or the classical Greek tradition in particular,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:21.100
is they have no reference to Christianity. And

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.095
in the Western world, so many assumptions, the

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:28.695
outlet, is suffused with all of these assumptions

00:22:28.695 --> 00:22:31.575
and concepts that we get from Christianity. That

00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:33.815
when you read somebody who's not arguing against

00:22:33.815 --> 00:22:35.095
it or in favor of it, they just

00:22:35.095 --> 00:22:36.535
don't have it as a reference, it didn't

00:22:36.535 --> 00:22:41.930
exist. You go, Oh, wow, the ancient Chinese,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.130
this was not a thing. So, their view,

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.810
their outlook, their assumptions are just different. And

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.970
this gives you the opportunity to free your

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.335
mind, to expand your understanding of the world,

00:22:53.335 --> 00:22:56.135
to break out of thought habits. And so,

00:22:56.135 --> 00:22:58.855
when you read in the classical way, what

00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:01.095
you're doing is saying, I want to enter

00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:03.335
into a conversation, I want to spend time

00:23:03.335 --> 00:23:07.060
with these great minds, these great characters. And

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.340
it's not that they're going to agree, because

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.940
they're absolutely not going to. You know, Dostoevsky's

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:20.455
Raskolnikov, Dmitry Karamazov is not Achilles, is not

00:23:20.455 --> 00:23:25.495
Menchus, is not Nietzsche. These are just different

00:23:25.495 --> 00:23:29.735
people, right? But it is all these opportunities

00:23:29.895 --> 00:23:32.350
to go, wow, this is a great Thinker,

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.990
this is great work, this will expand my

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.870
understanding of myself and the world again, back

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.230
to there. Because it's unlikely that you will

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.750
have access to your immediate environment, to a

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.995
collection of minds and writers and thinkers who

00:23:47.995 --> 00:23:51.115
are as great as the greatest thinkers who

00:23:51.115 --> 00:23:54.155
have been collected throughout the history of Ban.

00:23:54.555 --> 00:24:01.035
Right? So, this is the point. Not just

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.580
books, by the way, we'll talk about that

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.860
too. You don't want to spend all your

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.700
time reading the classics, this is another way

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.220
of going wrong. But it is a really,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.515
really significant aspect of this. One thing that

00:24:16.515 --> 00:24:18.355
has developed, and this would be a Renaissance

00:24:18.355 --> 00:24:20.275
idea and later, so this is Renaissance and

00:24:20.275 --> 00:24:23.635
Humanism, in particular, later Humanist idea. I think

00:24:23.635 --> 00:24:26.115
there's a lot of merit in this. And

00:24:26.115 --> 00:24:28.915
they said that the only thing that is

00:24:28.915 --> 00:24:32.340
necessary for a great education is to read

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.180
history. That history is the subject par excellence.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.420
And the reason for that is just what

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.220
we've been talking about, because a good understanding

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:49.385
of reading great histories really expands your outlook

00:24:49.385 --> 00:24:52.025
on the world and your ability to grasp

00:24:52.025 --> 00:24:55.865
the world and your ability to see maybe

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:58.105
reflections of yourself where you didn't expect it

00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:00.160
or to see something totally new that you

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.280
never knew existed. And so there's an argument

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.600
that's been made, I think there's, wouldn't say,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.120
yeah, this is absolutely it, that there's a

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.840
great merit in reading histories, and particularly in

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.265
reading histories from previous time, because again, histories

00:25:15.265 --> 00:25:18.225
written today are written with a series of

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:20.865
assumptions and all this, that may not be

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:22.945
held earlier. And so you get not just

00:25:22.945 --> 00:25:25.665
a history, but you also get sort of

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:28.065
a mind that is shaping, that is from

00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:30.720
a different culture, different world, a different period.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.040
And so you get a very different sense

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.440
of an understanding of the world when you

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.880
read histories from different periods. So, this is

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.960
why you want to read the dead people,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.895
right? So, people say, Oh, you're just reading

00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:45.935
dead old texts, it's like, Yes, exactly, there's

00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:50.095
a very good reason for this. Second, the

00:25:50.255 --> 00:25:54.735
white thing is just, no, this is also

00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:58.090
not true. Because, well, you know, you get

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.010
the whole thing on racism and blah blah

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:04.170
blah, but the notion that Greeks or Romans

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.810
were white is, that's only been around for

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.610
about twenty years. That was when the notion

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.835
of whiteness was invented by German thinkers about

00:26:12.835 --> 00:26:14.835
one hundred and fifty years ago, it did

00:26:14.835 --> 00:26:19.875
not include specifically to exclude the Latin and

00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:24.115
Greek, wanted to, that wasn't there. Certainly China,

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:32.470
India, these sorts of cultures, Spain, it's just

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.630
silly, it's just a silly concept. You could

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.725
exclude all the classic works from the white

00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:42.485
Anglo Saxon Protestant world, if you like, just

00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:46.005
never read those, and you'll still have a

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:48.965
lifetime's worth of classic works to read from

00:26:48.965 --> 00:26:53.445
dead people who are not in any way

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.780
associated with being white. And then finally, the

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.380
men problem, which is real, is simply a

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.100
representative of the systematic discrimination against women throughout

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.295
history. So, it doesn't mean you shouldn't read

00:27:07.295 --> 00:27:10.175
living women, you certainly should. And you should

00:27:10.175 --> 00:27:12.415
also read the works of dead women, you

00:27:12.415 --> 00:27:16.655
certainly should. But to exclude the great works

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:19.215
of the past, because women were excluded in

00:27:19.215 --> 00:27:21.970
the past, is simply to blind oneself to

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.290
some of the great works of all time.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.930
And one of the beautiful things about our

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.330
own period is we can look forward now

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.130
and say, in a century, this problem will

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.410
start to really vanish. Because they'll go, Oh,

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.585
now we'll have collection of 100 years of

00:27:38.585 --> 00:27:41.305
great works by women, and so then it'll

00:27:41.305 --> 00:27:44.905
be just dead people problem. And that looks

00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:46.425
good, because you want to read things by

00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:51.465
dead people. So, that's why Classics, to engage

00:27:51.465 --> 00:27:55.920
with and expand your understanding of the world

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.320
in ways that are just not possible if

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.000
you stay within a very small confine. Also,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.360
by the way, this is the problem with

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.240
textbooks. Textbooks are a type of evil in

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.005
general, argue, particularly for these kinds of material.

00:28:10.005 --> 00:28:13.525
You can have great mathematical textbooks, I guess,

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.885
science textbooks to a certain extent, but the

00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:20.005
problem with a textbook is it is generally

00:28:20.005 --> 00:28:23.800
won by committee, always a bad idea, and

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.400
two, is trying to communicate information. Now, information

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.640
is fine, but this is not what the

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.760
classics are about. The classics and the classical

00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:37.915
education is about being inspired by and spending

00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:41.195
time with great minds who are grappling with

00:28:41.195 --> 00:28:45.915
great issues. That's it. And when you have

00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:49.115
a committee trying to grapple with efficient presentation

00:28:49.115 --> 00:28:52.330
of information, while you may get some information

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.690
and it may be presented efficiently, this is

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.850
not the same thing. This is not what

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.370
a classical education was about. It's not about

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.650
efficiency. It's not about information and facts, although

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:06.865
those might be there as well. One of

00:29:06.865 --> 00:29:08.785
my great examples that I like to think

00:29:08.785 --> 00:29:11.505
about in these terms is Menchus. If you

00:29:11.505 --> 00:29:14.545
if you have any sort of overviews or

00:29:14.545 --> 00:29:19.040
something about Taoism or classical Chinese philosophy, it's

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.120
easy to miss the fact that Menchus is

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.320
hilarious, right? That he was funny. And actually

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.960
there's a fair amount of Chinese philosophy that

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.200
is funny. And if you don't get that,

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.845
if you don't ever encounter it, then you've

00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:40.845
missed 70%, eighty % of this. It sort

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:43.485
of because he does spend a fair amount

00:29:43.485 --> 00:29:45.805
of time poking holes and sort of all

00:29:45.805 --> 00:29:49.830
this overwrought and self important, and he's, you

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.230
know, it's great. By the way, Nietzsche is

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.110
also funny, something that's often overlooked, I would

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.950
say painfully often overlooked, he's quite hilarious in

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.725
many passages. Someone, I think this is why

00:30:01.725 --> 00:30:05.005
Derrida is so difficult for people to understand

00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:07.885
at times, is because, no, he's making jokes.

00:30:07.885 --> 00:30:11.405
A lot of what he's doing is he's

00:30:11.405 --> 00:30:14.810
being funny. I mean, he's kind of he's

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.370
performative in his writing style. It's theatrical times.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:24.730
And so, that, when you don't actually engage

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.410
with the mind, when you don't read the

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.525
original, when you don't spend the time, you

00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:34.485
lose that. This is what a classical education

00:30:34.485 --> 00:30:37.605
was about. It was literally about setting aside

00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:40.645
the time to spend with the great minds,

00:30:40.645 --> 00:30:44.840
having reading capacity to spend it with great

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.000
minds and to be able to engage with

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.760
them and to see the flavor and get

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.120
this sensibility. So, it's not about, you know,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.320
when did the Normans invade England, it was

00:30:54.945 --> 00:30:59.425
about the sense of the world that the

00:30:59.425 --> 00:31:02.465
historian has who's talking about this. So, you're

00:31:02.465 --> 00:31:04.785
getting the history, but you're getting a whole

00:31:04.785 --> 00:31:10.720
lot more. The challenge here is this is

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.560
what I call the Shakespeare Problem. Without doubt,

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.320
in the English language, Shakespeare is certainly of

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.560
captain of the team, as it were, like

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.075
a very, very important, just hugely influential writer,

00:31:26.955 --> 00:31:32.315
unbelievably difficult to read. And so that's the

00:31:32.315 --> 00:31:34.900
problem with these classical texts. They're often not

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.860
that friendly because they weren't written to be

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.580
friendly. One, they're written often at remote times

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.860
and two, they're written by people who may

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.500
or may not want to be like us,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.355
right? They had different outcomes, different they weren't

00:31:51.355 --> 00:31:53.995
trying to be efficient, they were trying to

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:55.835
do other things, they're trying to express themselves

00:31:55.835 --> 00:31:58.555
and their ideas of the world. And so,

00:31:58.555 --> 00:32:01.835
it's like, oh, Shakespeare's really, really, really hard

00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:05.195
to read, like, virtually impossible for most people.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:09.030
I've taught Shakespeare for many years, usually about

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.150
once a year I would do a class

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:12.630
on Shakespeare once every two years and it

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.990
would take an entire quarter of a class

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.310
of training students to read Shakespeare to get

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.750
to the point where they could read Shakespeare

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.075
and enjoy it and have the play start

00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:23.835
to come to life in their minds because

00:32:23.835 --> 00:32:27.675
they really weren't written to be read on

00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:29.595
the page, they were written to be performed

00:32:29.595 --> 00:32:32.555
on the stage. But you lose a lot,

00:32:32.555 --> 00:32:34.155
lots of the texts are cut, you just

00:32:34.155 --> 00:32:36.720
lose so much if you've only seen Shakespeare

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.080
performed, as opposed to visited the actual text.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.760
And Shakespeare may be a particularly difficult version

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.040
of this, but I do think of it

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.640
as the Shakespeare problem. And so how do

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.375
you approach reading in this way? I mean,

00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:54.455
like I said, did work on the project

00:32:55.815 --> 00:32:57.655
specifically to try to address this to give

00:32:57.655 --> 00:32:59.415
online stuff to help people and to get

00:32:59.415 --> 00:33:03.080
notes but fundamentally it is, I would say,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.760
do two things that are unnatural. Maybe three

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.280
things, I would say three things that are

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.040
unnatural in our culture. One is read slowly,

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.400
right? It's like, Oh, I'm gonna go spend

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.840
time with my best friend, I want it

00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:19.955
to go as quickly as possible so I

00:33:19.955 --> 00:33:22.595
can go on and do other things. No,

00:33:22.595 --> 00:33:25.955
right? You gotta get there, like, you're doing

00:33:25.955 --> 00:33:27.555
other things quickly so that you can go

00:33:27.555 --> 00:33:31.715
and spend time with these great works and

00:33:31.715 --> 00:33:34.490
say, Okay, so set aside an hour or

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.170
so. Because it's hard to read these things

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.490
for any sustained period of time and really

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.690
be with them. But if you can do

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.850
a page in an hour, that may be

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:47.205
spectacular, that might be great. So one, just

00:33:47.205 --> 00:33:49.285
go slowly, sometimes you can go faster, it

00:33:49.285 --> 00:33:51.685
depends, like Dostoevsky, you know, some of his

00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:53.765
sections are incredibly rich, some of them are

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.365
like, okay, come on, you're getting paid by

00:33:55.365 --> 00:33:57.845
the word buddy, like you're padding it out,

00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:00.085
you know, but he's definitely worth the time,

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.540
but there are big books and some of

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.340
it is, you know, sort of vexing, but,

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.540
you know, take the time that's necessary, but

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.700
you should be prepared to go really slowly,

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.220
it's not a race, you don't get a

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.925
prize for finishing early. There just isn't because

00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:18.485
it's the spending the time with the minds

00:34:18.565 --> 00:34:21.445
that matters. To take a lot of notes,

00:34:21.445 --> 00:34:24.965
mark those books up, write notes, look up

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.830
references. My recommendation is usually read whatever section

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.350
you're gonna do, maybe it's like, Oh, I've

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:31.710
got, you know, an hour I'll do these

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.550
five pages or something, don't know, whatever the

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.670
section is. Just go through it real quickly,

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.350
not quickly, but just read through it one

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.950
time, just go, Okay, I got the lay

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.405
of the land. Then go back through and

00:34:42.405 --> 00:34:44.565
go slowly. And then go through and take

00:34:44.565 --> 00:34:45.925
the notes and then go, Oh, now I

00:34:45.925 --> 00:34:47.605
see this. Oh, now this makes sense. It

00:34:47.605 --> 00:34:50.245
didn't make sense the first time. But take

00:34:50.245 --> 00:34:54.645
those notes, write questions, answer back, by the

00:34:54.645 --> 00:34:57.130
way, strongly recommend this. If somebody says something

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.770
that's just you're like, What? Go, No, no,

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.170
no, like, stop and argue with them, right?

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.730
Because this is the conversation, the spending time

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.050
with them. It's not about, Oh, they're right,

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.410
I just need to take this all in.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.930
It's like, Why are they saying this? Does

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.045
this make sense? Hey, maybe that I'm gonna

00:35:12.045 --> 00:35:13.965
put a little note here and go, yeah,

00:35:14.285 --> 00:35:17.085
I'm not so sure this is correct, right?

00:35:17.085 --> 00:35:23.970
This interrogative style. And finally, if possible, find

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.650
somebody else to talk to or a few

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.690
other people to talk to about this. Because,

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.210
you know, invariably, talking to people brings out

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.130
things that you didn't even know you knew.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.565
You'll say something and go, Wow, that's right,

00:35:36.565 --> 00:35:38.325
yeah, I agree with that, right? Or, that's

00:35:38.325 --> 00:35:39.845
a good observation I just made, I didn't

00:35:39.845 --> 00:35:41.365
realize I had that in my mind. Like

00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:44.245
conversation tends to drag this out and make

00:35:44.245 --> 00:35:46.485
it grow. Of course, other people will provide

00:35:46.485 --> 00:35:48.540
all kinds of insights and things you didn't

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.380
see and like oh I never would have

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.300
asked that question or oh that's a wow

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.860
what an amazing oversight, you know, that I

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.420
missed this incredibly obvious big thing that was

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.340
probably in bold on the page and underlined

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.900
and yet somehow you know flew right over

00:36:03.315 --> 00:36:07.155
my head. And so, that ability to engage

00:36:07.155 --> 00:36:10.035
with other people and have these conversations will

00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:14.195
bring these classic works to life today and

00:36:14.195 --> 00:36:16.355
you'll just start to live them and you'll

00:36:16.355 --> 00:36:17.800
start to see this and then once you

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.200
start doing this, what happens is you begin

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.760
to see the relevance of these works, whichever

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.360
ones you choose, it's everywhere, it's just everywhere

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.640
because they've lasted for several thousand years because

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.800
they do communicate this way, I mean this

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.955
is why they're still around. If they didn't

00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:35.475
do that, if they seemed totally pointless and

00:36:35.475 --> 00:36:37.955
irrelevant, they would slowly die. And this has

00:36:37.955 --> 00:36:39.475
happened with works that in the past have

00:36:39.475 --> 00:36:42.035
seemed super important and over time they just

00:36:42.035 --> 00:36:44.675
vanish because cultures change so much or styles

00:36:44.675 --> 00:36:46.810
have changed so much, they just don't seem

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.130
that important today. Although, you know, later they

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:54.170
might come back. So, this is writing and

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.690
reading. So, for writing, again, it's just very

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.305
simple. Write slowly, as again with reading, read

00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:02.865
slowly. Again, the opposite of what our culture

00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:10.225
tells us. Second, use reference materials, grammar checkers,

00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:14.700
spell checkers, other people to review your work,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.900
go through multiple drafts. This is the way

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.900
you increase the quality of your writing. And

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.595
just write simple and very direct sentences. English,

00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:27.275
and direct sentences work. You make less errors,

00:37:27.355 --> 00:37:31.275
they're clear, and people love it. With reading,

00:37:31.275 --> 00:37:36.635
very similarly, read slowly, take notes, be interrogative,

00:37:37.515 --> 00:37:41.240
and, you know, if possible, them with other

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.880
people. You'll see the similarities of these processes,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.000
right? That, you know, to help them grow

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.265
in your mind. And, if when you again,

00:37:52.265 --> 00:37:53.785
when you start to do this, it will

00:37:53.785 --> 00:37:55.945
start to change your pattern of your understanding

00:37:55.945 --> 00:37:58.185
of your self expression of the way you

00:37:58.185 --> 00:38:03.065
comprehend the world. And this is how that

00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:06.520
classical foundation of grammar was laid in the

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.360
ancient world. So that your understanding of the

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.560
world is improved, very important, and your ability

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.560
to express yourself and to achieve your ends

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.920
in the world is improved, very important. And

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.735
it matters for many reasons, but another one

00:38:21.735 --> 00:38:23.415
that I'll leave you with here is when

00:38:23.415 --> 00:38:26.135
you start to do this, what happens is

00:38:26.135 --> 00:38:28.055
you're spending time with the great minds of

00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:32.295
the world. You're expressing yourself in increasingly clear

00:38:32.295 --> 00:38:35.790
language, so your ideas become coherent in your

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.630
own mind and you can put them on

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.710
the paper and then you can compare those

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.110
ideas to ideas of some of the great

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:48.205
thinkers throughout history. Ah, this matters and not

00:38:48.205 --> 00:38:51.405
just a little bit, this matters a lot.

00:38:51.965 --> 00:38:54.365
And perhaps the classic work here is The

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:59.005
Politics and the English Language by Orwell, who

00:38:59.005 --> 00:39:02.560
wrote, of course, famously 1984. And the point

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.200
Orwell is is pressing in both of these,

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.360
Politics and English Language, I can highly recommend,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.320
it's only very handful of pages long, a

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.405
great work on why all of this matters

00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:15.565
and how you understand the world and read

00:39:15.565 --> 00:39:18.685
and write really, really matters. And the point

00:39:18.685 --> 00:39:21.645
is that what politics tries to do with

00:39:21.645 --> 00:39:24.525
language and what advertising and all that is

00:39:24.525 --> 00:39:27.810
it's not they don't try to make you

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:32.130
believe something that's wrong, that happens as well,

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.010
but they try to eliminate the ability of

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.130
language to have meaning. They try to take

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.050
from you your capacity to think, so that

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.775
what's red today can be called blue tomorrow

00:39:45.775 --> 00:39:48.015
and what's blue today can be called red

00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:50.415
tomorrow. So, if I just convince you that

00:39:50.415 --> 00:39:53.855
red is blue, that's fine. I've changed your

00:39:53.855 --> 00:39:58.170
definition of something. What propaganda really wants to

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.250
do is make it so that you have

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.130
no comprehension of the world, that you have

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.650
no handhold, you have no ability to organize

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.045
your own thoughts, to express them clearly on

00:40:09.045 --> 00:40:11.685
paper, and you have no idea to ability

00:40:11.765 --> 00:40:14.245
to look at the world and organize it

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:18.005
fully. And we're inundated with this because of

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:21.390
advertising, because of political propaganda that surrounds us.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:24.750
You know, read Orwell doesn't need too much

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.270
belaboring, I think everybody's familiar with this concept.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.150
But I think people don't appreciate that this

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:36.350
is specifically what a classical education was designed

00:40:36.535 --> 00:40:39.495
to fight. It was designed to try and

00:40:39.495 --> 00:40:44.135
help people think clearly, express themselves clearly, and

00:40:44.135 --> 00:40:47.575
understand the world clearly on their own terms.

00:40:48.535 --> 00:40:51.140
Right? Not by saying: Oh, well this what

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.420
somebody told me, therefore I believe it. This

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.020
is considered sort of Academism or there's many

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.460
names for this, but it's sort of the

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.940
Aristotelian trap that was fallen to in much

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.340
of the Middle Ages or, you know, just

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.075
appeal to authority, authority, the sorts of errors

00:41:07.075 --> 00:41:10.515
that happen endlessly. But this is the ability

00:41:10.515 --> 00:41:13.955
to free one's mind from the sorts of

00:41:14.995 --> 00:41:19.315
infinite number of traps and confusions and bafflements

00:41:19.315 --> 00:41:22.250
that our world abounds in so that we

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.810
can then form our own ideas, hold them

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.810
clearly, hold them up to the world, compare

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.690
them to reality, and make judgments for ourselves

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.735
and express ourselves. And so when people say,

00:41:33.735 --> 00:41:36.295
Oh, your writing is fine. Oh, it is

00:41:36.295 --> 00:41:38.375
fine. If it's filled with errors and you're

00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:40.855
not using the words correctly, but it's fine,

00:41:40.855 --> 00:41:43.495
right, it's fine. What they're really saying is,

00:41:43.495 --> 00:41:45.255
A, probably I don't know how to fix

00:41:45.255 --> 00:41:47.175
it and I'm too bothered, it would take

00:41:47.175 --> 00:41:49.610
too much time. Also what they're saying is,

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.290
actually, I really don't care that you learn

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.370
to express yourself. I don't care that you

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.010
ever really have the capacity to think clearly.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:02.010
I don't care that because you're never gonna

00:42:01.455 --> 00:42:03.535
be in a position where it matters, right?

00:42:03.535 --> 00:42:05.695
This is something like, I don't really care

00:42:05.695 --> 00:42:09.215
what happens to you. If you knew someone

00:42:09.215 --> 00:42:11.215
was gonna be your brain surgeon, you would

00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:14.380
be really, really concerned about their medical education.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.060
But, because we don't think that it matters

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.980
how most people are educated, we're just like,

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.820
Ah, whatever, it's good enough, it's close enough,

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.580
it doesn't need to be that great, doesn't

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.940
need to be that clear, doesn't need to

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.420
be that error free, that's fine, it'll do

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.365
blah blah. That's the world. But the idea

00:42:31.365 --> 00:42:33.365
in the classical world is because these people

00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:35.125
were assumed to be the people who were

00:42:35.125 --> 00:42:36.885
gonna be in power or they wanted to

00:42:36.885 --> 00:42:40.405
take power, you really cared, like everybody really

00:42:40.405 --> 00:42:44.245
cared. If for no other reason, then the

00:42:44.245 --> 00:42:45.740
people you were teaching, if you were a

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.020
tutor, could have you executed again. You could

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.020
get in trouble if you really messed up.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.060
And so, in a system, in a world

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.220
that really doesn't care that much, it is

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.540
important for us to care, for us to

00:42:58.815 --> 00:43:00.815
say, No, no, I really do want to

00:43:00.815 --> 00:43:03.375
be able to express myself. I really do

00:43:03.375 --> 00:43:06.255
want to be able to think clearly. And

00:43:06.415 --> 00:43:08.815
again, there's no shortcuts, but it's also not

00:43:08.815 --> 00:43:13.295
that confusing. Write a lot, write regularly, and

00:43:13.295 --> 00:43:15.910
write carefully, and your writing will improve, and

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.390
soon you'll be writing much better than most

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.230
people, because most people don't do this. Read

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.430
carefully, read slowly, read the great works, whichever

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.110
ones appeal to you. Not all great works

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.430
appeal to everybody, because we're all different, time

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.285
periods are different, different interests, but just search

00:43:32.285 --> 00:43:34.365
about, find the ones that work for you,

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:39.005
inform yourself. And when you're trying to think

00:43:39.005 --> 00:43:40.845
clearly and you're spending time with some of

00:43:40.845 --> 00:43:43.420
the great thinkers and writers from the ancient

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.980
world or from five hundred years ago or

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.060
one hundred years ago or whatever it is,

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.940
what you'll find is it really does begin

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.420
to reshape how you think about the world,

00:43:54.615 --> 00:43:57.015
yourself, and how you feel about what's going

00:43:57.015 --> 00:44:00.535
on around you. Really an extraordinary thing, but

00:44:00.535 --> 00:44:02.935
it's something that, again, pretty much we have

00:44:02.935 --> 00:44:06.215
to do on our own now, because this

00:44:06.215 --> 00:44:07.975
is not the way the world is structured.

00:44:07.975 --> 00:44:09.655
For good or ill, that's just the way

00:44:09.655 --> 00:44:12.670
it is now, and so here's an opportunity

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:16.510
to begin this process ourselves. So, thank you

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.390
very much. So, that's the trivium grammar, part

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.030
one. Second part of the trivium will be

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.900
logic. So, next time we'll look at a

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.740
lot of the logical fallacies, the way we

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.380
get confused, and sort of how to create

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.100
a system for dealing with that. Thank you

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.580
very much.
