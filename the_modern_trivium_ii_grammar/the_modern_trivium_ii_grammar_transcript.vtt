Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.720
the Modern Trivium part two in which I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.120
get down to the details. Last time I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080
went through sort of the historical and philosophical

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.720
background to frame this series of lectures. This

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.015
time let's get down to it but just

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:19.975
again a quick note summary summary from the

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.855
last one is the goal of a classical

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:27.735
education was to give people the power to

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.720
express themselves themselves and to achieve what they

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.480
wanted to achieve in the world and so

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.880
you need to understand yourself and understand the

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.280
world to be able to do that and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.181
then to have the skills necessary to pursue

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.340
your goals. And so, keep this in mind

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.781
because this is sort of the core of

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.540
this. Powerful people
