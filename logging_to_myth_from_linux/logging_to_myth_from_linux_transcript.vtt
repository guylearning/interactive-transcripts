00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.880
Hi there. This is Chris. And in this

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.720
video, I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.080
log on to the Myth computers from a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.840
Linux computer. And I happen to be running

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.105
Ubuntu. You can this will work for any

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.385
flavor of Unix or Linux that you have.

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:20.865
In Ubuntu, I can click up here to

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.905
actually find the terminal program. So you need

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:25.745
to be able to open the terminal. And

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.510
when I open up the terminal program, I'll

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.510
make it a little bit bigger here. When

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990
I open up the terminal program to actually

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.190
log on to the myth computers, type s

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.390
s h for secure shell and then your

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.710
SUNET ID, mine happens to be c greg

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.495
and then at miff dot stanford dot edu

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:48.575
and in fact if you're on the Stanford

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:50.095
campus you don't even need to type the

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:52.495
stanford. Part, you can just type c greg

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:55.215
at miff and then when you log on

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:56.895
the first time it will ask you if

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:59.470
you're sure you wanna continue, you will answer

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.670
yes. And then, it will never ask you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.910
that again actually. But it does ask you

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.750
for your password. Now, if I type my

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230
password in here, you'll notice as I'm typing

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.455
it that, it is not showing up on

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.775
the screen and that's just a security method,

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:20.815
a security measure so that you, nobody can

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:22.255
look over your shoulder when you're typing your

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.335
password. But rest assured you could be typing

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:27.295
and your password is going into the, computer.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.880
And then you're logged in and so that's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.760
about it. If we there's some other commands,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.960
I happen to have a one zero seven

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.800
directory which we can c d into and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.720
you can type your commands like l s

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.440
etcetera. A couple commands you might wanna know

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.760
just basically being in the terminal are clear,

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:47.255
which clears the screen, and then reset, which

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:49.175
also clears the screen but in a slightly

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.775
lower level. And, how do you log out

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:55.495
of the NIF computers? You just type log

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:57.655
out and then enter or you can type

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.780
control d and that will also log you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.980
out. Thanks.
