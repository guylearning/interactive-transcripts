00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Hi there. In this video, I'm going to

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.520
talk about using what we call tab completion

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.320
to speed up typing commands and and going

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.720
to various paths in your directory structure, etcetera.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:18.745
And tab completion is, pretty simple. Just means

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.785
that whenever you get to a, typing a

00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:24.985
file or a path that you know what's

00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:26.985
coming, or even if you don't, you can

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:30.345
actually hit the tab key and it will

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.430
automatically try to fill in, as best it

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.510
can. And if it's unambiguous, it'll be able

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.350
to fill in as much as you need

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.590
for the, the command. So for instance, I

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.230
happen to have a folder here on Myth

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:46.655
that is, let's see, c s one zero

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.135
seven. And in c s one zero seven,

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:50.735
actually, let's do a tree on C S

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:54.095
107. On C S 107, it there's actually

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.055
a fair amount of things here. It it

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.655
has a whole bunch of folders in it.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.530
One is called assignments. And in the assignments

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.130
folder, there is another set of folders. Let's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.290
see. What's a good one here? There's assign

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.530
one, and then assign one has folder one,

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.465
and assign one has file one, etcetera. So

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:20.825
let's do this. If I want to l

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.465
s c s one zero seven, now I

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.465
just type the c s and watch what

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.890
happens when I hit the tab key. Boop.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.970
It fills in the rest of it very

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.410
quickly because it happens that there are no

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.890
other files in my main directory that are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.530
c s one zero seven. And then, if

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.170
I type a and I hit tab again,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.325
it doesn't do anything. But if I hit

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:44.605
tab twice, it will say, oh, okay. You've

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.205
got two things that I've been trying to

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.805
fill in, both start with an a. So

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:49.885
if I type a s and then tab,

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:51.485
it will fill in the rest of assignments.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:53.165
Now you'll notice this is actually pretty quick.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:55.405
If you know where you're going, you can

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.860
get there very quickly. Okay. So in assignments,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.740
I think there were a whole bunch of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.940
assignment sign. Yep. So all all the rest

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.260
of things started with AS were assign. And

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.580
then if I hit tab again, it will

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.475
show me all the different choices. So let's

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:12.635
do assign zero and then if I hit

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.075
tab, it will fill in the slash for

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:15.995
me. And then I think I had some

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.155
things in assign zero started with f. Nope,

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:20.395
maybe not. So let's actually hit tab a

00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:21.755
couple times and it will tell us, oh,

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:25.470
there's all our choices. So if I have,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.950
let's say output file, if I type o

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.350
u tab, it fills in the rest of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.670
it for me. Okay. So let's actually do,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.990
let's actually change to a directory c d

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.485
c s tab, assignments tab assign one tab,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.485
there, and then boom, I got there very

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:44.045
quickly without typing much at all. Okay. And

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.085
then c a c d f, and it

00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:48.920
will be a folder for me. It it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.520
actually is kind of clever if you do

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.080
c d f, it will actually know that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.640
you can't c d into a file, so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.600
it automatically fills in the f for folder.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.280
It fills in the folder part for you.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:02.935
CD folder two. And if I look at

00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:05.735
that, there's nothing in there. CD to go

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:10.135
back. Let's see. CD folder one and in

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:11.815
fact there's nothing in there as well. And

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:13.575
I knew that by just continuing there's no

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:17.240
other folders I could change into. So again,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.000
you can get to a can get to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.640
a folder very quickly without typing much, thanks.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.680
So let's go back to my home directory

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.640
and watch this again. CD CS one zero

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.600
seven assignments assignment one folder one. Boom. I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.785
got there in about two seconds and I

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:34.945
didn't have to type anything more than the

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:37.425
first character of each one of those names

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:40.625
in the path. So tab completion is super

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.025
fast. It's something that you should really start

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.424
to use so that you don't sit there

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:48.784
and take all this time typing things in.

00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:49.584
Thanks.
