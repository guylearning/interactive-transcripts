00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi there. This is Chris, and I'm going

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.880
to show you how to use the l

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.400
s command when you're logged into the Linux

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.925
Smith computers. And to do that, it's pretty

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.485
simple. You actually, once you're logged in, there's

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:20.285
a command called l s, just l s

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:21.805
and it will list all the files in

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.405
your folder. I happen to have a whole

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:25.805
bunch of files in my home folder here.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.270
But if we, let's say we're gonna go

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.670
into my one zero seven folder with the

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.270
c d command, which is covered in a

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.710
different video. I can type l s and

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.025
get all the files in there and that's

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:41.505
the basic way of using the command, but

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:44.065
the ls command has lots of different flags

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:45.745
that go along with it. So you can

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.225
type ls dash l and it will list

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.105
all your files, all the non hidden files

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:54.210
as it turns out in a, an interesting

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.250
format here that, tells you more information about

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.090
the files. It tells you in fact how

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.170
big the file is and it tells you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.930
whether the file is a directory or not.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.610
The little d at the beginning here means

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.395
that it's a directory. So the assign zero

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:09.955
folder in the old and the pandoc folder

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:14.115
here are, all, directories. So if I type

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.995
c d to change directory into the pandoc

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:20.050
folder, it will, go into there and then

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.730
that's that's an actual folder that I can

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.250
do l s on and see all the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.850
files in that folder as well. Some of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.650
the other, flags that you can use, I

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.130
like the l s dash one which lists

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.025
them all out one after the other and

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:35.625
then I can just scroll back and back

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:36.905
and up and down here and see them

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.145
like that. Sometimes that's nice. As I said,

00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.385
the l s dash l works great. L

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:44.185
s dash al means even show me the

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:47.250
hidden files as well. So in this case,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.050
there's a couple of files that are hidden.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.770
Files that begin with a period are all

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.410
hidden on your in your folder system. So

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.650
anything that's actually starts with a period is

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.645
hidden, including the two interesting directories called dot,

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:07.725
which means the current directory that you're in,

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.525
and dot dot, which means your previous directory.

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:13.405
And that's also covered in a different video

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:15.965
on the c d command and working directories

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.150
and so forth. If you wanna know more

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
information about LS and all the different flags,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.630
you can type man LS for the manual

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.190
page and it gives you the manual page

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.830
here and it says all the different types

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.950
of flags and there's a ton of flags

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.535
for for the ls command. And by the

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.615
way, I'm just using the arrow keys to

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.895
to go down in this file and see

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:42.335
all the different commands. You can also type

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:44.335
q to quit out of the manual page.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.900
My favorite l s command is l s

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.860
dash a l r t, which means list

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.020
all the files including the hidden ones, list

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.620
them in that special format that gives me

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.340
more information, list them in reverse order, and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.735
list them by time. So what this actually

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:01.135
does is it lists the files in the

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:03.615
reverse order from when they were created. This

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:04.815
directory is not the best one to do

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:06.415
it. Let's go into a previous directory. L

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:08.815
s dash a l r t says, okay.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:15.620
I created the old folder, the most, most

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.660
passed and the newest folder happens to be

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.420
the pan doc folder here, which is, like

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.780
that. So I like the l s dash

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.075
a l r t to give you just

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:27.755
a listing of, like, hey, which files did

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.235
I modify most recently? Those are ones at

00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:32.635
the bottom of the folder. So that's it

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:34.075
for the l s command. You will use

00:03:34.075 --> 00:03:36.235
this every single time you log on to

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.395
the myth computers, and you should get used

00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:39.515
to it. Thanks.
