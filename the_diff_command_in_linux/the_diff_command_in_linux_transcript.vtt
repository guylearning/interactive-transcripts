Hi there. In this video we are going

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.280
to look at the diff command, D I

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.320
F F. And the diff command allows us

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.400
to see the differences between two files. Now

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.445
it does take a little bit of time

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.885
to kinda get used to the diff output,

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.205
but we're gonna look at some examples here

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:23.085
and see what we can find. But it's

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.485
useful if you wanna know what's changed between

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.180
two versions of a file or two files

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.180
in different directories or so forth. So here's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420
how we generally use it. Well, first of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.940
all, let's look at some files that we

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.300
have here. We have a file called hello

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.900
dot c and I also have a file

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.155
called hello two dot c. And the only

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:46.035
thing different in these two files is there

00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:48.275
is an uppercase o in this file here

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:50.515
and there is a lowercase o in this

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:53.870
file here. Now if I type diff and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.350
we type hello dot c and hello two

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.230
dot c, we get the output that says

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.030
something weird here, we'll talk about in a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.830
second. And then we have the line from

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590
the the two lines that are different in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.950
this case, the line from the first one

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.455
that's different and the line from the second

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:13.535
one that's different. And as it turns out

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:17.295
the c here means that, it's a change

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:19.775
from one file to the next. Okay? And

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:22.255
it turns out that from the first file,

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:26.470
which is the left facing angle bracket, is

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.750
changed to the second file both happen to

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.070
be on line five. That's what that means.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.350
So it's pretty easy to say okay look

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.950
these are the two file lines that have

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.735
changed and, that's that's that. Okay? Let's look

00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.575
at a different one. Let's look at hello

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:45.575
three dot c. Hello three has the o

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:47.815
here as well, the uppercase o and it

00:01:47.815 --> 00:01:49.815
also has an extra line which isn't in

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:53.530
the first one which is comment line in

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.130
there. Now if we do the same thing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.690
again, we say diff hello dot c and

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.050
hello three dot c, watch what happens. It

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.305
says, okay. It says there is, there are

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:10.425
two changes. Well, actually one is an addition.

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:13.385
On line three in the first file, which

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:15.545
is would be added at line four in

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:17.945
the second file, okay, or is added in

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:19.705
line four at the second file is this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.680
comment. Okay. So from line three in the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.000
first file, it's not there. We add it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.880
in line. The second file, a comment is

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.295
there. Okay. In the five c six here

00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:36.815
is the same thing as before, there's a

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:42.655
change on line five in the first file,

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.415
they've got the lowercase o and the file

00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:46.415
line five and the second file it becomes

00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:48.410
or line six rather because of that extra

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.810
comment line, it's the uppercase o in that.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.970
Okay? Now it turns out that it has

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.530
to the way these work, there's add, there's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.090
change, there's also delete. Watch what happens if

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.345
we do diff hello three dot c and

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.985
hello dot c. Watch what happens. Well, first

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:10.625
of all, says okay fine, at line four

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.385
in the first file which is now hello

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:15.185
three dot c. At line four, we would

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:18.900
delete that line and that would be at

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.780
line three in the original. Okay, that's what

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.820
that means. And then, the six c five

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.260
means oh, we at line six we change

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.380
the uppercase to lowercase which is in line

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.475
five in the first file. Okay, That's how

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:40.395
the actual diff command works. Again, it takes

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:41.835
a little time to figure out what it's

00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:45.115
actually doing. The numbers here are relevant because

00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:48.500
it allows you to automatically make changes from

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.940
one file to the other if you just

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.500
have the diff between them. So that's a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
that's kind of a neat thing. And, by

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.780
the way, diff uses, generally, I don't know

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.035
if the diff we use is this exact

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:03.155
algorithm, but it uses the longest common subsequence

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:07.235
problem to figure out where there are, common,

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:09.795
like, differences in the file and, you may

00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:11.315
have learned about that in CS one zero

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:12.675
six b. Thanks.
