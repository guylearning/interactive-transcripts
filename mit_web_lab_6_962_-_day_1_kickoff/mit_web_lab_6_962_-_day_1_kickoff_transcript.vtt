00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
Hello? Hi. Okay. Welcome to Web Lab twenty

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.520
twenty five. My name's Stanley. I'm one of

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.480
the co presidents. My name's Andy. I'm also

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.625
co president. Just some few things to go

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.025
over really quickly while we go over sort

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.905
of our intro spiel. Make sure you have

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.865
done the setup because we have workshops today,

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.105
so you'll be following along. And you won't

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:29.385
be able to do that if you haven't

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.520
gotten your stuff set up. So if you

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.880
haven't, go to weblab.ishomework0 and just make sure

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.280
you finish the setup. If you already have

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.735
it done, then good job. Okay, let's talk

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.695
about what Web Lab is. Web Lab is

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.655
essentially a web development class. We teach front

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.375
end to back end full stack web development.

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:58.935
We have free lunch every day of lecture.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.800
We also run a competition for the second

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.320
half of the class throughout IEP and there's

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.840
a lot of cash prizes for you to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
win. And if you register on Websys, we

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440
are graded a PDF and we give you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.715
guys six units of unrestricted elective credit. So

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:21.635
this is this year's course staff. They're sitting

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.875
over there. They'll be the ones helping you

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:31.440
throughout this class. Some more reminders, make sure

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.320
you're registered on the portal. The portal is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560
also where we send email communications and it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.080
also where you guys are going to be

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.280
submitting your milestones so make sure you have

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.015
that done. Also join the Piazza. We're going

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.655
to be posting a bunch of important info

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:52.535
on Piazza and also it's a great place

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:55.895
to ask questions, so make sure you have

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.510
that done as well. Lectures will also be

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.630
livestreamed and recorded to YouTube, and you can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.630
join the livestream at weblab.islivestream. The lectures are

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.030
not mandatory and we don't take attendance. This

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.270
is just purely what you put into the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.870
class is what you get out of the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.305
class. And, yeah, you can also join the

00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:20.145
Zoom directly if you just wanna watch the

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:24.865
lecture being streamed. We'll go over some logistics

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:28.380
now. So the competition is not mandatory, it's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.020
a second half and it's completely optional. But

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.940
we'd highly encourage you to submit your website

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.020
anyways because who knows, maybe you'll win some

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.540
cash. We'll also have live help during the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.095
workshops and the lectures. And you can go

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:45.135
to weblab. And then you can just create

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:47.615
a ticket and we'll be walking around helping

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.295
you answer questions and stuff like that. You

00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:53.400
can also go to the questions doc at

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.920
weblab.isquestions and here you could just ask questions

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.840
anonymously. There's also an old doc with questions

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.520
that were asked in previous years so you

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.880
can also check there to see if your

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.585
question has been asked before. And then we

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:10.585
also have weblab.ininfo so you can go here

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:13.545
to find a bunch of useful short links,

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.945
resources, stuff like that. And we'll also have

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.505
a team finding mixer at the end of

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.980
lectures today So if you don't have a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.180
team yet, don't worry. You can stay after

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.420
class and find some people. So here's a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.740
little course overview. This is our general schedule.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.855
So week one we're gonna be sort of

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:39.175
laying the groundworks, learning the basics and building

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:41.735
an app from scratch together. Week two we're

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:43.815
gonna start getting a little more complicated. We're

00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:45.735
gonna add some cool features, go into some

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:48.535
advanced topics and also get some sponsor lectures.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.510
And then week three is where we're done

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.390
with class and now we're entering the competition

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.390
phase. So now you're going to be working.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.470
You can either submit your website to the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.790
competition or just simply for the milestone for

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.485
credit. And then week four, you finalize your

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.445
projects, you make your final submissions, we're gonna

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:10.125
judge them, and then we go to the

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.765
award ceremony. And you can check the schedule

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:15.725
on the website if you need any specifics.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.100
We take you end to end and what

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.260
that means is we take you from front

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.340
end to back end. The world of websites

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.260
is really big. There's a lot that goes

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.780
on with something like Facebook, Club Penguin, ChatGBT.

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:38.225
So how does it all work? This is

00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:40.945
just a bit of an intro to what

00:04:40.945 --> 00:04:42.625
you'll be seeing this week and sort of

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:47.585
next week. Any time we access a website,

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:50.380
we're going to Chrome and then entering a

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.300
URL. But what really happens, you know? So

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.380
you are the client. Think of yourself as

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.420
a computer. And think of the server as

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.620
just another computer, let's say, like Facebook's computer,

00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:07.555
where you want to send a request to

00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:10.835
get the website that you put into your

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:15.955
URL or into Chrome. So essentially, you're sending

00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:19.870
a GET request to Facebook to get the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.710
website that you want. And this computer responds

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.870
because it stores and serves the website that

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.750
you're actually requesting. So it responds with the

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.345
web page files, which are then taken by

00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:39.265
the browser that you're using, probably Chrome, which

00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:40.865
is then used to view the website. So

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.025
that's how we see everything on the Internet.

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:47.340
We have URLs, and request websites from servers.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.660
We get back those web page files and

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.260
then we see whatever we see on the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
screen. So it's a pretty oversimplified view of

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.075
the client server architecture. And then these actual

00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:04.115
web page files that we're receiving are HTML

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:07.635
files, which display content like the basic building

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:13.920
blocks, CSS files, which style the HTML, JavaScript,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.720
which lets these files, I guess, have, like,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.560
actions, and then assets, like images, GIFs, etcetera.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.415
Yeah. So what exactly are we gonna be

00:06:28.415 --> 00:06:30.655
building in this first week and leading into

00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:34.975
next week? I'll open up this website just

00:06:34.975 --> 00:06:36.655
for you guys to see it really quickly.

00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:39.775
But essentially, we're gonna be building this entire

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:42.620
website from the ground up. It's going to

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.260
be called Catbook, and you can also visit

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.900
it by going to this link. But it's

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.060
going to have a home page, a profile,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.700
live chats, a game, and then other aspects

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:03.005
as well, such as authentication. So more about

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.485
the course now. There's gonna be four milestones

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.325
for everyone to complete if you're taking this

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:10.930
class for credit. Milestones zero is gonna be

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.890
due this Wednesday, and it's gonna be ideation.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.210
Essentially, you're just gonna be creating a list

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.170
of topics or project ideas on a Google

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.330
Form and then submitting that Google Form. It's

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.250
pretty simple, and it should really only take

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.705
like an hour or even less. But yeah,

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:30.505
we'll be sending out information soon for that.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.265
Next is project pitches. It's going to be

00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:36.585
this weekend. You're going to have to sign

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:40.120
up for a time slot for some slot

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.640
either Saturday or Sunday from one to 5PM.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.720
It's gonna be around, I think, thirty minutes

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.080
or maybe less. But at this point, you

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.160
would have a project idea, and you would

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.505
be pitching your projects to some of the

00:07:54.505 --> 00:07:56.745
staff members and we'll give feedback about it

00:07:56.825 --> 00:07:59.545
and hopefully give some helpful advice about how

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:02.185
to get started, what pitfalls you might fall

00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:06.025
into, and how to navigate the entire course.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.040
Milestone two is pretty long after. It's gonna

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.520
be Wednesday, January 22. And this is your

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.600
MVP. So some sort of working prototype for

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.755
your project. We're not expecting the whole thing,

00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:24.275
but we want to see a lot of

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:30.035
functionality already figured out by then. And then

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:33.115
the final website, Milestone three, is due January

00:08:33.115 --> 00:08:36.720
29. That's around the end of IEP during

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:47.155
week four. Any questions about these milestones? And

00:08:47.155 --> 00:08:50.995
as a reminder, passing the class just requires

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:53.555
you to do all four of these milestones,

00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:56.275
so it's not too hard. As long as

00:08:56.275 --> 00:08:58.195
you put in effort and it's clear that

00:08:58.195 --> 00:09:00.515
you have, then you'll be on your way

00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:07.040
to passing the class. So more about the

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.040
actual websites that you will be building. So

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.760
you'll be building some dynamic website supported by

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.360
a back end, so not just like a

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.245
front end you might be able to build

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:20.045
through like some website builders. You're gonna be

00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:22.525
creating pretty much the whole thing yourselves. So

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.405
front end, back end, database, everything is gonna

00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:29.740
be built by you. We want the website

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.500
to have personalized experience based on user accounts,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.820
so some sort of authentication like you saw

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.700
on the example website. We want it to

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:45.325
be different based on who's logged in. Minimum

00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:47.725
security requirements fulfilled. This isn't that big of

00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:50.045
a deal, but yeah, we don't want your

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:57.080
website to be a vulnerability or whatever. We

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.520
want you to be creative and have your

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.160
own original design for the website and implementation.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.160
A lot of the code is going be

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.720
given to you from the skeleton code that

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.920
we'll provide, but past that, we'd like you

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.465
to implement as much as possible yourself. All

00:10:12.465 --> 00:10:14.625
the code should be your own. And then

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:17.025
if you do use any other outside code,

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:22.465
to just cite it properly and limit that

00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:28.250
use if possible. And then everyone should have

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.730
a GitHub repo by now or if you

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.370
haven't already, that's okay. You should have received

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.930
instructions from an email to set up the

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.635
GitHub repo and this should be shared between

00:10:38.635 --> 00:10:41.115
your teammates. It's only private to you guys

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:43.595
and we can also like check out this

00:10:43.595 --> 00:10:46.395
repository so that we can help you on

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:53.770
our end. Some cannots for the website. You

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.890
cannot create a website using pre existing, like,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.535
website builders like WordSpace WordPress or Squarespace. You

00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:04.935
cannot use any part of a previous project,

00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:07.495
just so that the playing field is level

00:11:07.495 --> 00:11:13.095
for everyone. You cannot outsource your development. You

00:11:13.095 --> 00:11:15.255
can't tell your friends who are really good

00:11:15.255 --> 00:11:16.700
at web development who are not taking the

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.580
class to do the website for you. We

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.060
hope that this class is more or is

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.700
mostly just like an opportunity for you to

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:33.775
learn by actually creating. Yeah. So for judging,

00:11:33.775 --> 00:11:37.135
there's four categories. The first is functionality, so

00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:39.775
just like whether or not your website works

00:11:39.775 --> 00:11:43.295
as intended. These are like the technical components

00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:45.100
and we'll just be like playing around with

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.940
your website to make sure that it's working

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.780
fine. Usability is more about like the user

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.660
experience, making sure that the website is easy

00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:00.075
to use. Aesthetics, self explanatory. And then concept

00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:03.595
execution. We want your website to sort of

00:12:03.595 --> 00:12:08.475
have a purpose. Main use of web development

00:12:08.475 --> 00:12:10.315
is really to just create products that are

00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.675
actually useful or achieve some goal. So we

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:16.590
want your website to do something or solve

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.030
some problem that you have come up with

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:26.590
like a good solution. Okay. So how do

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.665
you get help throughout this entire course? Number

00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:33.785
one tool is Piazza. If you haven't already,

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:38.265
please join weblab.ispiazza. Ask questions at any time.

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:40.185
I think our average response time is like

00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:44.180
five minutes during the course. We're constantly on

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.060
it answering questions as fast as we can.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.940
Go to the course website if you have

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.700
more questions about the course logistics, if you

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.300
want to visit the schedule, if you want

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.220
to read the rules about the competition more.

00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:03.455
Visit the course website info or weblab.isinfo for

00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:07.855
resources. It has all of the links that

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:12.890
you can I'll actually just open it. At

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.730
the bottom, you can find all the things

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.410
that we're pretty much going over in these

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.210
slides, as well as more information about the

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:26.985
contest here, and then FAQ. And then please

00:13:26.985 --> 00:13:28.745
show up to office hours too. I think

00:13:28.745 --> 00:13:31.785
in person feedback and help is a lot

00:13:31.785 --> 00:13:36.185
more useful than Piazza actually. Yeah. So office

00:13:36.185 --> 00:13:38.025
hours are usually seven to nine, and you

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:46.760
can find them on the schedule. So, yeah,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.840
today we should have office hours from seven

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.800
to 9PM. If you need help with homework

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.055
zero, setting stuff up, please show up. Or

00:13:55.055 --> 00:13:57.295
if you have other questions from lecture, also

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.015
please show up. Office hours are gonna be

00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:03.375
in thirty two zero eight two, so in

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:08.590
Status Center. And then finally, we have extended

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.350
office hours called Hackathons. They basically run from

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.190
7PM to 1AM. So our sponsors are going

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.430
be there as well to sort of see

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.105
how everyone's doing. But yeah, these are during

00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:24.265
week two and three. There's gonna be two

00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:27.945
of them. There'll be food provided, drinks, etcetera.

00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:35.580
It's pretty fun and very helpful. Okay. Yeah.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.780
So what else is there to WebLab? Besides

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.620
just building the website from scratch, you'll learn

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.825
a lot about UI design, learning version control,

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:50.825
which is really helpful in all the MIT

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:53.065
classes you take in the future. This is

00:14:53.065 --> 00:14:57.465
what I was referring to earlier, git. If

00:14:57.465 --> 00:14:59.385
you're not a course six three or some

00:14:59.385 --> 00:15:01.305
course six, this is sort of a taste

00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:04.840
of course six three at MIT. Hopefully, you

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.920
enjoy and take more CS classes in the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.080
future. And then if this is your first

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.240
time learning web development, hopefully this is a

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.175
great first experience for you to create something,

00:15:16.175 --> 00:15:19.055
create your own thing from the ground up

00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:28.820
and much more. So most importantly, WebLab is

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.180
not a classic MIT class. It is rendering

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.140
IAP and we are on the PDF scale,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.380
so you're only graded pass fail pretty much.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.620
As long as you do all the milestones,

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:44.925
you'll be good, and you'll receive a pass.

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:47.485
Make sure that you're also in the portal

00:15:47.485 --> 00:15:49.405
once again so that we can actually mark

00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:53.485
down the milestones for you. It's also all

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:57.240
student run, so everyone who's a TA or

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.040
a staff for WebLab is here so that

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.960
your experience in this class is as good

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.520
as possible. We want to help as much

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.360
as possible, that's why we're TA ing this

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.265
class. And at any time, if you have

00:16:09.265 --> 00:16:15.505
questions during class, please visit weblab.isquestions or weblab.isq.

00:16:16.065 --> 00:16:18.465
Q lets you ask a question on a

00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:20.625
ticket and then a staff member will actually

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:22.880
go and visit you to help answer your

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.280
question in person. WebLab is also just a

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.920
great opportunity for you to meet new people

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.760
during lecture, during office hours, and hackathons. Hopefully,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.040
you'll spend a lot of time with your

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.200
team to create a website you guys all

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.225
love and then you'll have a great time.

00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:45.465
Okay. So the last part is every year

00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:48.745
we have a theme. In past years, the

00:16:48.745 --> 00:16:50.585
themes have been around the world, remember the

00:16:50.585 --> 00:16:53.385
future, and then two years ago it was

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.460
and I, last year it was send it

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.340
or blend it. They're pretty open ended. But

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.420
this theme is essentially like what your website's

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.500
gonna be sort of some take on this

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.595
theme. Hopefully it's open ended enough to the

00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:09.275
point where you can just do whatever you

00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:13.595
want and adapt it, sort of relate it

00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:19.035
to the theme. And as is tradition, we

00:17:19.035 --> 00:17:20.875
have a theme reveal video.
