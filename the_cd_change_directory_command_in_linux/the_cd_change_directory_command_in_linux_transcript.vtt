Hi there. This is a video on the

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.240
c d or change directory command in Linux.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.080
And I'm just quickly gonna describe the c

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.240
d command and you will use it every

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.705
single time you log on to the NIF

00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:19.665
computers or any other Linux computer. It's just

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.625
that important command. Basically, it is your way

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:27.665
of navigating through the file system. So c

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:30.440
d stands for change directory. Okay. To change

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.800
to your home directory, I happen to be

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.680
in my home directory. Let's say I wasn't,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.240
let's say you're in one zero seven assignments,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.800
assignment zero, whatever. If I wanna change to

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.520
my home directory, I can either type c

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.795
d tilde, which does that. C d minus,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:46.995
by the way, goes back to the previous

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:48.755
directory. Or I can just type c d

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:51.235
and c d also takes you to your

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:54.915
home directory. To change to the parent directory,

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:56.915
so if I go back to the sign

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.675
zero directory and I wanna go to the

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:03.520
parent directory, I can do that by just

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.440
typing cd dot dot and that will take

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.520
me up to the assignments directory and cd

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.280
dot dot again will take me to the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.000
cs one hundred seven directory etc. By the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.195
way, if I'm in assignments assign zero I

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:16.875
can type c d dot dot slash dot

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.555
dot slash dot dot and that will take

00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:19.675
me all the way back to my home

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.675
directory because it just kinda climbs up the

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:24.795
directories. Remember dot dot just means the previous

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.595
directory. So if you go the previous directory

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:30.395
slash the previous directory slash the previous directory,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.070
it will go all the way back to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.790
your main commands. So that's really about it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.950
for the cd command. There's not too much

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.550
more to it except to say that you

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.390
should get very used to using it and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.615
very used to using it with the dot

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:49.495
dot and with the tilde. So for instance

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.815
if I wanted to change to, let's say

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:54.855
I was in CS107 assignments and I wanted

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:58.615
to change to CS107 old, I could type

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:03.481
cd cs107old and that would take me right

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:08.041
there. Right? So that's how it works. Thanks.
