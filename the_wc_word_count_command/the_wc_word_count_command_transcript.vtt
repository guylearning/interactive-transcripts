Hi there. In this video we're gonna look

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.280
at a small command called wc which stands

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.400
for word count and it's pretty straightforward. Word

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800
count and then a file name gives you

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.825
the number of lines in the file, the

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:15.425
number of words in the file, and the

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:17.425
number of characters in the file. And if

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:19.505
you just want one or the other, you

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:23.105
can do w c say dash l hello

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.305
dot c will give you seven as the

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:29.829
number of lines in the file. So that's

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.429
about it. Not too much more to it.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.749
Thanks.
