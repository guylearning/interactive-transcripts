00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.760
Hi there. This video is about how to

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.600
use the make file to make your programs.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.245
It's actually very simple. There's only a few

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:16.685
things you really need to know, but we're

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:20.205
gonna dig into, what Make does, a little

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.765
bit, just to kind of familiarize yourself with

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.205
it. If you have a folder, and most

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:27.725
of our assignments are going to come with

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:32.370
Makefiles built into the starter code. If you

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.610
have a make file and you type make,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.610
well, it runs a bunch of commands that

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.450
are built into that make file to actually

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.770
compile your program using g c c. So

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.305
for instance, when I type make, it ended

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:45.305
up typing g c c dash g dash

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:48.105
o zero dash blah blah blah, and it

00:00:48.105 --> 00:00:50.585
compiled our program. And in this case, can

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:54.185
say hello, and it actually prints out hello

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:58.740
world in three different languages. So what is

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.420
a make file and why do we use

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.980
make? Well, make files are nice if you

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.940
have programs that have multiple different program code

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.660
files like multiple different c files, like you'll

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.355
notice up here I have helloworld.c and hello

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:16.235
language dot c and we also have a

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:20.235
hello h file like that. And make files

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:23.035
make it so that you can compile your

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.195
code and what it does is it only

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:27.700
compiles what it needs to based on whether

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.860
or not you've made changes to the file,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.100
since the last time you made, the program.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.780
So, so that's the the basically what you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.885
need to know is type make. You can

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:43.005
also type generally make clean which will clean

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.605
up any of the temporary files that may

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:50.205
have been stored as you when you've been

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:53.565
compiling. And it basically cleans the program and

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.630
makes it so that it does have to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310
recompile everything. So for instance, if we type

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.230
make, it will make our program and then

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.510
hello will exist. And then if we type

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.095
make again, it will say hello is up

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:08.815
to date, meaning that we don't actually need

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:10.655
to compile again. The one thing you do

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:12.895
need to remember is when you're using make

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:15.695
files, after you make any changes to a

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:19.340
program file, text file, a dot c file

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.620
or header file, you always need to rerun

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.180
make so that it recompiles your programs. I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.100
don't know how many times I've seen students

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.060
make some changes to their hello world program

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.615
And, so watch this. If we type hello

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:36.455
and then hello dot c, oops, that's not

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:40.615
it. If we look at, hello languages dot

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:41.895
c and we go and we say, oh,

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.895
maybe we wanna put an exclamation point after

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.160
world like this and we make the change

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.440
and we save it and whatever and then

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.720
we try to write hello again and we

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.360
say, wait, there's no exclamation point. Well, the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.440
reason is because we never made the program

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.960
again. So you have to make and it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720
recompiles it for you and then if you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.055
type hello, then the exclamation point will be

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:00.895
there. So you have to remember to do

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:03.695
that. Now, very quickly, if we wanna look

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:06.175
at the actual make file itself, this one's

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:07.695
a very, simple one. The ones we use

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:09.935
for CS one zero seven are generally more

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:12.570
advanced, but this gives the basic idea here.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.250
Comments start with a hash and, then we

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.170
define a couple variables in here. In this

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.250
case, the variable is the compiler we're using,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.970
which is GCC, and then some flags, which

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.890
are just the options we're gonna pass to

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:28.935
to the compiler. Okay? And then the next

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:32.375
line here is the actual, it says if

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:37.095
you're going to do hello, then it says

00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:39.175
these three files are the ones that can't

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:42.320
change. And if they're not changed, don't need

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.600
to rerun it. But if any one of

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.920
them changes, you need to rerun the following

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.800
command down here. Okay? And it's just a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.960
bunch of dependencies that set it up. The

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.040
one interesting thing to note is that this

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:56.335
has to be a tab. It can't be

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:57.695
a bunch of spaces. So if you're ever

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.055
writing your own make file and it gives

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:01.375
you these syntax errors in there, think about,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.975
oh, did I make all my tabs correctly?

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:07.500
It's just a weird part of, Nick. But

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.540
it basically says, okay, if all these, if

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.860
something's changed in any of these files, run

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.500
this command. Well, it's dollar sign parenthesis c

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.300
c means just replace this with what c

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.580
c is, so it says g c c

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.965
and then then this is replaced with the

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:25.085
flag, so dash g dash o zero etcetera.

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.565
And then the rest of this gets compiled.

00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:30.285
And, that's that in the clean command set.

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:31.725
Now by the way, could also type make

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.060
hello, it'll say hello is up to date.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.540
Make clean removes hello and removes any object

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.300
files which we'll talk about when we get

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.140
to that in class. And then if I

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.540
type make hello again, it will make it.

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:48.265
I believe that the first thing that gets,

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:49.945
run when you type make is the first

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:53.465
one that's that's here. So that's that's that.

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:56.745
So anyway, using make fairly straightforward. If you

00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:00.444
wanna dig into how to actually modify your

00:05:00.444 --> 00:05:02.684
make files, there are lots of examples online

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:04.284
on how to do that. Thanks.
