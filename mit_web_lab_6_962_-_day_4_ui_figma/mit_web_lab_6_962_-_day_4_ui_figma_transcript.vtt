00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. So now we'll go into something that's

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.400
no code and a bit more fun. Okay.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.200
So how do we design a website? To

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.120
address this question, I think a better question

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.075
to ask is, why do we design our

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:19.155
websites? And in the center of any website

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.315
design is our users. So we design a

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.155
website to serve our users. We want our

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.675
website to be usable, and two core concepts

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:29.750
we consider as a website designer is UI

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.270
and UX. UI dictates the visuals of our

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.070
website, so it's the initial impression that our

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.030
users get when they come onto our website

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990
and interact with it, and UX describes more

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.445
of the user flow as our user goes

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:46.125
from page to page as they interact with

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:50.365
their website. So any good a good UI

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.445
UX is a UI UX that delivers the

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:54.525
content and functionality of a website to its

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.250
users well, But this can take a lot

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.170
of different forms. There's no one good recipe

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.570
to make a good UI UX. So first,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570
we'll take a look into user interface or

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.905
UI. Your UI should be led by a

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.465
design guideline and this is specified by the

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:15.825
fonts used in your website, color palettes, the

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.945
spacing and layout, and maybe the reusable components

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:23.460
you use in your front end. So here's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.300
the design guideline that was used for many

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.260
years on the WebLab website and our slides,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
but recently we had a UI change on

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.100
our website so you might not see this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.955
UI format on the website anymore. But as

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.435
you can see, in this UI guideline, specify

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:41.115
the fonts we use for different text throughout

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:44.475
our website and the color palette used throughout

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:49.550
the website. The fonts and colors that you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.470
use can give off a very strong initial

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.550
impression of your website to your user. So

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.870
they're very important and you should definitely take

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.790
some time to think about what fonts and

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.430
colors you pick for your UI guidelines as

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.775
you design your websites. So first, we'll start

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:05.855
off with fonts. So if you're an MIT

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:08.175
student here, you have access to the Adobe

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:10.575
Creative Cloud and that allows you to use

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:13.455
Adobe Fonts. So this is the Adobe Fonts

00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:17.215
website and you can add any family of

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:19.920
fonts to your web application or download any

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.120
fonts. And I really recommend it. It's a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.200
great tool for finding fonts for your website.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.280
You can filter by tags for like maybe

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.725
different fonts you're looking for. And so this

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:35.405
is the front page of Adobe Fonts and

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.725
as you can see, these different fonts give

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:40.845
off very different impressions already. So I just

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:42.845
like went ahead and wrote down maybe my

00:02:42.845 --> 00:02:45.325
initial impressions of all these fonts and I'm

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:46.925
sure that you can you have different impressions

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:48.960
of these fonts as well. Like for Ivy

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.880
style, this is a very modern and clean

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.800
font and you might wanna use it for

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.880
a very modern user interface, whereas for mini

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120
arcade or Limon, you might not wanna use

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.120
those for your body text of any website

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.975
and those might be more suited for a

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.735
heading of your website. So same thing for

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:09.935
colors. This is coolers.co and it allows you

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.855
to pick color palettes and edit color palettes

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:17.580
and similarly colors also give off a very

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.220
strong initial impression to the user. So I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.220
also went through this and like wrote down

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.100
my initial impressions. You might have similar initial

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.015
impressions, maybe not. But yeah, that's one thing

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:32.215
to consider and yeah, here are some tools

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:33.735
you can use on coolers. You can pick

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:37.895
palettes and adjust the palettes. And another thing

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:41.015
to think about is color psychology, which you

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:45.490
can look through on your own. So the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.570
impression that are so as we saw just

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.810
saw, UI can give off a very strong

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.930
impression to your users through fonts and colors,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.570
but this depends largely on your user base.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.530
So your users will change throughout time and

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:02.485
throughout culture. So yeah, UI trends change over

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:05.205
time and vary across culture. And now we'll

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:07.285
take a look at some examples of how

00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:10.965
it does that. So here's the MIT website

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:14.310
in 02/2003 versus now. So as you can

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.510
see, the MIT website moved towards a more

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.070
minimal UI. We have a white background now

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.470
instead of the teal and green background. We

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.710
have more spacing for the words so that

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.655
there's a more minimal and empty layout and

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:34.135
we also replace text with icons where possible.

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:37.255
So overall, we see a trend towards a

00:04:37.255 --> 00:04:39.575
more minimal UI in the past decade and

00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:41.255
a great example of how we can see

00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:43.390
this shift is by looking at how icons

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.390
change over time. So here's the trash can

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.470
icon and icons were originally introduced in 1973

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.910
when Xerox introduced the graphical user interface. So

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.070
in the very beginning, we have very primitive

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.985
and pixelated icons and as we move through

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:01.505
the .com bubble in the early late nineties

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:04.385
and early two thousands, we move towards skeuomorphic

00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:08.065
icons which were originally designed to be very

00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:11.185
user friendly because they mimic how these icons

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.070
might look in real life. But as we

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.750
move through the twenty tens and in the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.230
past decade, we have more minimal and flat

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.270
UI icon layouts. But recently, I think we're

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.430
starting to move away from the minimal UI

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.085
as a lot of icons now have more

00:05:27.085 --> 00:05:31.405
shadows and maybe some dimension added to them.

00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.445
Here's a cool website you can check out

00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:36.605
on your own time. So you might wanna

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:38.765
see how your favorite websites have changed over

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:43.940
time. This is the web design museum. So

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.700
as we just saw, we've been moving towards

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.020
a more minimal UI, but the minimal UI

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.340
isn't preferred by all users in today's digital

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.700
age. One example of this is how the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.835
UI for web design varies between western culture

00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:01.595
and sorry, western websites and maybe some what's

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:04.075
websites in East Asia. So this is the

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:06.635
Yahoo front page and on the left is

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:08.715
the English Yahoo web page that you can

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:11.790
log into in The US, and on the

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.110
right side is the Japanese Yahoo front page.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.710
So something really interesting is that Japan's UI

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.230
more mimics how websites in the West look

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.030
during the .com bubble and it's a lot

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.775
more cluttered. There's no there's no central focal

00:06:26.775 --> 00:06:29.415
point, and it's a lot less minimal. And

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:31.975
this is because across culture, users have different

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.375
needs. In the West, users prefer a more

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:39.735
simplistic layout with major focal points that summarize

00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:43.470
the information, whereas in East Asia culture, there

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.790
are high context cultures that prefer more information

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.870
that tell them more about a website. So

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.950
this really brings home the point that you

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.790
really need to consider your user base when

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.465
you're designing a website. So how do we

00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:01.825
make our own website's UI look good? As

00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.625
we mentioned earlier, you should use UI guidelines

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:07.745
because this provides consistency throughout your website. So

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.425
here are some tools for you to pick

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:12.970
colors and typography, and another important point is

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.010
to reuse components. So one thing you can

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.130
use is the UI component library. Here's an

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.210
example of a component library that I like.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.530
It's called Mantine and it allows you to

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.250
customize your components and reuse them throughout your

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.585
website. Another important part of making your UI

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:34.305
look good is responsive design and this means

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:37.345
that your website will look good on all

00:07:37.345 --> 00:07:40.065
devices of different sizes. So one thing you

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:42.145
can do to check how your website looks

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:45.340
on screens of different sizes is by using

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.220
inspect element and changing the dimensions of the

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.860
website. So for example, here's the web lab

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.215
website. We can go to inspect and on

00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:58.095
the on the right panel, on the top

00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.415
left of the right panel, you can toggle

00:08:00.415 --> 00:08:05.215
device toolbar and pick dimensions. So here's how

00:08:05.215 --> 00:08:09.320
it might look on the iPhone SE. As

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.560
you can see, everything resizes and it still

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.240
looks good on a small screen. So this

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.680
is what we call responsive design. Stanley. Yeah.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.280
Thank you, Stanley. So just a quick aside,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.975
interactivity is also really cool. Interactivity is when

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:28.815
a user can interact with the website and

00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:30.655
maybe when you hover around or click on

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:33.375
something, you'll get a response back. This is

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:37.820
cool and it makes your website like really

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.300
catch someone's eye, but there are drawbacks and

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.140
it could take away from usability or be

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.580
very resource heavy on your browser. So here's

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.380
an example of an interactive website designed by

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.475
our CodePres Stanley. So as you can see,

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:53.955
we went through a recent UI change and

00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:55.715
with the new UI, it's a lot more

00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:58.595
interactive like you can hover over things and

00:08:58.595 --> 00:09:03.260
they'll change colors or opacity or you have

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.580
emoji, I don't know. Really cool. But yeah,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.900
our old website didn't have any user interactivity

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.500
at all. So it's a lot more eye

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.380
catching on the new website. Another example of

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.525
interactivity is for HackMIT, we're working on three

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:21.645
JS website for our upcoming high school hackathon

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.725
blueprint. I don't know if you guys saw

00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:28.685
that but oops. No, it's gone. But we

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:32.550
use a three d modeling apps to make

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.790
this cool room. Oh, why is it gone?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.230
Oh, and allows the users to like play

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.830
around with the room and click on different

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.670
items in the room. And on the right,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.790
it was just a cool profile page, portfolio

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.390
page that I found that where you can

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.605
interact with the different objects on the website.

00:09:48.765 --> 00:10:09.480
Now we'll go to UX. Oh, okay. Hi.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.400
I'm Annabel. Wait. I think you should stay

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.835
connected to yours for now. Okay. I'm gonna

00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:18.075
talk about UX. I'm speed through it a

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:19.515
bit because I think Sophie covered a lot

00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:22.075
of the really important points in her UI

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:25.675
section. But really quickly, basically, UX, we want

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:28.635
to consider things like how intuitive is navigation

00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:30.780
gonna be for our users, what queues can

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.860
they use on the website, how visible are

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.940
the essential elements that we really wanna highlight

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.100
on our web page, and is the information

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.580
that we're presenting presented in, like, a logical

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.260
manner where it's organized in a way that

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.740
users can easily understand how things are flowing.

00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:45.805
So let's take a really quick poll. Between

00:10:45.805 --> 00:10:48.045
these two ketchup bottles one and two, which

00:10:48.045 --> 00:10:50.605
one do you think better optimizes the UX

00:10:50.605 --> 00:10:52.845
for users? You can do like one finger

00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:56.280
for like one and two for two. Yeah.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.600
I'm seeing like only twos. And this is

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.080
correct because basically, like you can see in

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.960
the old Heinz ketchup bottle design, it's really

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.800
unintuitive to use because like if you have

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.560
ketchup left over, you're like digging at the

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.625
bottle to get the like leftovers out. Whereas

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.025
here, you're able to squeeze it much easier,

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:14.825
so it very much prioritizes user experience. And

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:16.105
we want to do the same thing with

00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:19.865
our web applications. So we want to use

00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:22.905
symbols, concept, and colors that are commonly understood

00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:25.520
across different cultures. Earlier, Sophie talked about how

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.320
UIs can differ between Western and East Asian,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.280
like, applications. But we will icons are kind

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.760
of universal, and we can use, like, specific

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.840
symbols that most people can understand to mean

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.840
certain things. For example, you can look at

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.765
the icon bars here and see, like, the

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:42.005
home page is, like, represented with a house,

00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:44.245
the search bar with the magnifying glass, etcetera.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.925
And there's also a lot of colors, like

00:11:45.925 --> 00:11:48.565
green is symbolizing, like, money usually or things

00:11:48.565 --> 00:11:52.180
to deal with, like, wealth. So just more

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.260
on, like, the color psychology that Sophie kind

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.500
of mentioned earlier. So this is, like, a

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.540
good ideal ratio to have, like, 60% of

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.020
a main color, 30% of a secondary color,

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.740
and 10% of an accent color. There's also,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.745
like, studies that show, like, which colors are

00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:08.985
more preferred by, like, different genders. And also,

00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:11.385
like, this website below, contrast checker, is really

00:12:11.385 --> 00:12:13.705
good for making your website accessible because you

00:12:13.705 --> 00:12:15.545
can check to make sure, like, you can

00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:17.305
play with your website on grayscale to see

00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:19.065
if it's still visible to, like, people who

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.940
are red green color blind. And also, like,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.020
that you have enough contrast for people who

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.260
might have, like, issues with, like, vision that

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.780
it can see all the colors appropriately. So

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.300
I'm sure you guys are all familiar with

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.100
Discord's UI, but one of the ways that

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.355
Discord optimizes its UX as well is by

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:37.835
having the buttons really centralized and very easy

00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:39.675
to click, so you know exactly, like, what

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:41.915
your options are upon entering the web page.

00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:44.315
So this was Facebook's old UI, and as

00:12:44.315 --> 00:12:45.755
you can see, it's like it was, like,

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:49.120
pretty unintuitive because the create an account boxes

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.120
are like super, super large, which is like

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.600
not great because like most of the time,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.040
users are not gonna be creating a new

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.280
account. Instead, they're probably gonna be logging in,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.880
and the login is like really tiny at

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.880
the top here. So that's like super unintuitive.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.560
Right? So we want our information flow to

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.025
be really easy for users to digest and

00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:07.185
understand. So this is why Facebook switched to

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:09.665
their new UI, is very clean, very nice.

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:11.825
We have the login front and center, and

00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:13.745
then create new account below that, which is

00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:15.585
much more intuitive. Right? Because we're probably not

00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:17.490
going be creating a new account every single

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.210
time. Okay. Let's talk about wireframing now. So

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.890
this is super, super important for you guys'

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.490
projects. So if you're tuning out, you should

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.090
pay attention now. Basically, wireframing is just like

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.945
creating a super rough draft of your web

00:13:28.945 --> 00:13:31.905
application. But it's very helpful because once you

00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:33.505
hard code things, it's going to be more

00:13:33.505 --> 00:13:35.105
difficult to change than if you have a

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.785
clear idea of what your application is going

00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:38.545
to look like before you actually start the

00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:40.625
coding. So you want to focus on the

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:42.690
overall structure of what your application is going

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.370
to look like and where key elements are

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.570
going to go. So you can see here

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.730
in this example, right, like, they have the

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.410
sidebar, they know what their nav bar is

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.770
going look like, and they know what sort

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.370
of tabs and pages they want on their

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.275
application. It can very drafty. It doesn't need

00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:56.795
to be anything formal. Just think of it

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.955
as like a rough draft mock up of

00:13:58.955 --> 00:14:02.235
what your website might look like. So to

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:04.555
make a wireframe, we have several different options.

00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:06.155
We can use Figma, which is what we're

00:14:06.155 --> 00:14:08.330
going be talking about later. You can also

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.410
honestly just make one on Google Slides, which

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.490
is nice because you can show transitions between

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.250
different pages. You can just draw it on

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.650
pen and paper or any other wireframe software

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.970
like Photoshop or Sketch. But we're going to

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.025
be using Figma because it has something that

00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:25.545
can be really helpful called prototyping. So prototyping

00:14:25.545 --> 00:14:27.625
is basically where you're just taking your wireframe

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:29.465
and you're bringing it to life. So you're

00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:32.345
going to add interactions to your wireframe and

00:14:32.345 --> 00:14:35.280
show which pages go where, which basically helps

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.400
improve your UI because you know exactly the

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.560
technical requirements needed to code it and where

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.440
users should be redirected to. It can be

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.720
very similar to the real thing. As you

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.835
can see, this is a very good prototype

00:14:48.835 --> 00:14:51.395
that includes all the interactions, like scrolling and

00:14:51.395 --> 00:14:54.435
redirects and things like that. So we're going

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.915
to be using Figma because it has really

00:14:56.915 --> 00:15:00.195
good real time collaboration as well as options

00:15:00.195 --> 00:15:03.530
for prototyping and adding interactions to your wireframe.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.330
So it's very helpful for our purposes. And

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.090
also, I think it's very intuitive for beginners

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.570
to use. Okay. So we're gonna transition into

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.570
a Figma demo or mini workshop. Basically, I'm

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.570
gonna go over the steps of, like, where

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.615
key things are, and then you guys are

00:15:18.615 --> 00:15:19.895
gonna get some time to play around with

00:15:19.895 --> 00:15:21.015
it on your own. I know we don't

00:15:21.015 --> 00:15:22.855
have, like, a lot of time, but hopefully,

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.055
I can speed run, and then you guys

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:25.575
will get some time to try it on

00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:31.360
your own. I don't know. Yeah. You can

00:15:31.360 --> 00:16:06.360
you can wait. There's still slides Okay. Cool.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.320
Yeah. So basically, all remember oh, can we

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:12.505
see the slide? So yeah. Okay. We all

00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:15.625
remember Catbook and what our this is like

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.225
if we were to create a wireframe for

00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:19.305
Catbook. So we're gonna just go through that

00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:21.625
really quickly. So you guys can follow along

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:23.465
with this step right now. Basically, you just

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:26.505
wanna make a Figma account at figma.com. And

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.650
I already have my account, as you can

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.210
see. But what we're gonna do is we

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.370
basically want once you get to the Figma

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.770
homepage, you wanna create, like, a new file.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.010
You would just click, like, create file, create

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.770
new in this corner right here, and then

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.330
you're gonna select design file. I'm just gonna

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.865
use the Catbook wireframe that I already created.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.945
But basically, upon creating a new file oh,

00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:50.625
you can also open this cheat sheet for

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:52.705
reference if you need any help or get

00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:57.280
stuck on things. It's weblab.is/figmacheat sheet. So just

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.080
some, like, quick basics. Everything in Figma is

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.280
kind of organized into layers. So you're gonna

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.440
see, like, on your sidebar that you have,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.680
like, your different pages, and then your elements

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.725
are all gonna shown there. Canvas, this center

00:17:10.725 --> 00:17:12.645
part is where all your stuff is gonna

00:17:12.645 --> 00:17:15.285
be shown. Tools at the bottom. So this

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.845
is showing, like, Figma's old UI. So right

00:17:17.845 --> 00:17:20.805
now, tools got relocated to the bottom. And

00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:23.090
then on the right hand side, you have

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.770
options for selecting additional things, which we're gonna

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.450
go over later. But I think the tools

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.050
are pretty intuitive, so I'm not gonna go

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.850
over them in-depth. But basically, you have move

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.255
and scale options, you can make frames, You

00:17:37.255 --> 00:17:38.695
can make shapes. You can draw with, like,

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:40.135
the pen and pencil. You can also do

00:17:40.135 --> 00:17:42.215
text, and you can leave comments, which is

00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:45.895
why it's really good for collaboration. Okay. So

00:17:45.895 --> 00:17:48.055
the basics of Figma is everything is going

00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:49.895
to be kinda contained in a frame. So

00:17:49.895 --> 00:17:52.535
let's start by making a frame. We just

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.780
I'm just gonna click here, and then you

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.820
can see you can choose different, like, devices

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.220
for your frame. I'm just gonna choose, like,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.940
desktop, and then let's do, MacBook Pro 14

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.615
inch. So here's our frame. A frame is

00:18:07.615 --> 00:18:09.455
a container for elements, and so this is

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:11.615
going to house everything on kind of like

00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:16.095
a page of our application. Right? So I'm

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.175
sorry. I did this. But frames are very,

00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:20.095
very powerful. So if you guys have used

00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:22.470
any image creation software before, even just like,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.790
PowerPoint or Google Slides, I'm sure you probably,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.350
like, are familiar with grouping items or objects.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.310
But instead of grouping objects for Figma, I

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.910
would recommend you to just make a frame

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.070
every time you wanna group objects because it's

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.285
much more powerful than grouping objects because you

00:18:36.285 --> 00:18:39.165
can size everything within the frame independently. You

00:18:39.165 --> 00:18:41.805
can also have, like, cool overflow content options.

00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:44.125
So that allows you to take advantage of,

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:47.405
like, clipping text. And overall, it's just better

00:18:47.405 --> 00:18:49.805
for if you wanna apply, like, consistent styles

00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:53.970
to everything. So let's make Catbook's homepage. So

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.290
for Catbook's navbar, I'm gonna do a frame

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.250
right here. And then you can change the

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.090
fill here. So you can see I'm changing

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:09.175
the color. The hex code is 2B73FF. So

00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:11.015
this is, like, gonna be our nav bar

00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:13.655
frame. Right? And then we can just drag

00:19:13.655 --> 00:19:15.415
text inside of it. So text is at

00:19:15.415 --> 00:19:17.920
the bottom on the tools here, and we

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.720
just wanna write, like, Catbook. Yeah. And then

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.640
you can, like, resize as you see fit

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.875
on the side, like how big you want

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.195
your text, what font, etcetera. I'm gonna go

00:19:31.195 --> 00:19:32.875
over all of it right now, because I

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:34.635
think you guys can play around with it

00:19:34.635 --> 00:19:37.275
on your own. But one of the key

00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:39.515
things about Figma that's really nice is, let's

00:19:39.515 --> 00:19:41.190
say we wanna make a profile page. Right?

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.190
Like, would we copy and paste our nav

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.430
bar over to our profile page? Like, thumbs

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.590
up if yes, thumbs down if no. Yeah.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.190
I probably wouldn't be asking this question if

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.590
the answer was yes. Right? So we're gonna

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.265
reuse it instead as a component. So you

00:19:56.265 --> 00:19:59.385
can see here, I have conveniently already done

00:19:59.385 --> 00:20:04.105
it. But basically, if I go to, like,

00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:07.385
the frame that we were just on and

00:20:07.385 --> 00:20:10.600
I click on it, I can right click,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.080
and then I can do create component, which

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.720
will essentially create a reusable instance of this

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720
navbar element for me. So if I go

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.200
to my assets, I've already made, like, a

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.155
better looking navbar component here. So this is

00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:26.235
the one that we'll be using. But basically,

00:20:26.235 --> 00:20:29.835
you can, like, create components which are reusable

00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:31.755
instances of stuff that you wanna reuse across

00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:33.915
multiple pages, like your nav bar, for example.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.150
So now, if we want to make a

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.790
profile page instead of, like, remaking our nav

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.230
bar or copying and pasting it, we can

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.590
go to assets, and then we can just,

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.550
like, insert instance here. And so we can

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.575
get, like, another nav bar, basically. Yeah. So

00:20:49.575 --> 00:20:53.655
that's how we would reuse our components. And

00:20:53.655 --> 00:20:56.215
then this step is pretty intuitive as well.

00:20:56.215 --> 00:20:58.615
You're basically just copying and pasting images. You

00:20:58.615 --> 00:21:01.735
can shape things by going here, and then

00:21:01.735 --> 00:21:03.975
you can change, like, the radius. So this

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.960
how I made it, like, rounded. Yeah. You

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.480
can review the slides more on your own

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.200
time. But, basically, when you edit components, when

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.280
you edit the main instance, it's gonna change

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.440
all other
