Hi there. This is Chris and I am

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
going to show you how to log on

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080
to the NIF computers from a Windows PC.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.560
I happen to have Windows 10, so I'm

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.080
actually gonna show you how to do two

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.775
different methods for logging on. If you happen

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:19.415
to have Windows 10, the easiest way to

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:24.855
log on is to install the Bash Ubuntu

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.975
subsystem into Windows. And to do that, you

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:32.430
actually go to this website right here and,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.510
it will tell you exactly how to do

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.750
that. I've already done that because it does

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750
take a little bit of time. But once

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.150
you do that, you should you should be

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.750
able to install that and then you'll be

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.085
able to use the bash terminal which is

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:50.485
very similar to the terminal that is actually

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:54.565
built into the the myth computers itself. So

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:55.925
this is the method I would suggest if

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:57.205
you happen to be on Windows 10 this

00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:58.790
is a great way to do it. What

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.630
you do when you have it loaded you

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.070
just go to the search and you type

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.070
bash b a s h or Ubuntu and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.750
when you click on that it pulls up

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.575
a window that looks like this and from

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:13.975
here we are going to use the SSH

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:16.855
command which is the secure shell and it's

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.495
built into the window here and you just

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:22.775
type SSH and then your SUNET ID, mine

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.310
happens to be CGreg and you type the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.110
@symbolandmiff.stanford.edu and you hit enter. And the first

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.550
time you connect it will ask you if

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.630
you are sure you want to continue connecting

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.710
and you should type yes and then it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.315
will ask for your password. And as I'm

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:46.155
typing my password, notice that it's not actually

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:48.315
being shown on the screen. This is a

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.875
security feature, it allows you to type your

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.955
password without somebody who's looking over your shoulder

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:54.875
to see it and, it's a nice feature.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.370
Anyway, you type that in and then it

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.530
brings you down to, the actual prompt. We

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.130
happen to log into myth nine here and,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.690
being logged into myth nine doesn't really matter,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.370
it just happened to log us in there.

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:11.165
And then from here you can type all

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:12.845
the different commands that you'll learn in other

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.485
videos like c d one zero seven changes

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.045
me into the one zero seven directory, l

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:22.205
s lists the files, etcetera. Couple commands you

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:24.750
might wanna know, when you're here, the clear

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.510
command will clear the screen. The reset command

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.190
will clear the screen in a little lower

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.190
level. So if the if the colors on

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.870
your screen get a little bit screwed up,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.150
it will do that. In fact, in here,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.750
it looks like it actually changed the size

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.645
of the window like that as well. So

00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:41.565
that's that. If you wanna log out, you

00:02:41.565 --> 00:02:44.285
just type log out and then enter or

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.685
you could hold down control and click the

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:48.845
d key. So let me try that. If

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:50.765
I hold down control and click d, it

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:52.685
will actually type log out for me and

00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:55.490
log me out. Okay? So that's how you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.730
use login. As I said, this is the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.290
preferred method because it's once you set it

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.210
up, it's all built into Windows and it's

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.770
kinda nice. You can do that, but there's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.095
another way too. If you're not on a

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:08.855
Windows 10 computer, you you have to do

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.815
this method. But there is a program that

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.295
you can download for free from Stanford called

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:18.295
Secure CRT. And, you go to this website

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:22.680
here and it actually, then you just download

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.880
it. You do your, your regular SUNET login

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.040
and you download it. Most people will use

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.720
the the 64 bit. If you happen to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.880
be on a really old Windows version, you

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880
may need the 32 bit, but the 64

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.615
bit should work for people. I have also

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.575
already installed that. And if you use that

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:44.775
program, you just type secure CRT and then,

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:46.615
you click on it and a little window

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:50.400
comes up. It actually prepopulates a couple of,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.760
different Stanford campuses, Stanford campus computer systems. We

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.560
are gonna use a third one, called NIF.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.400
So what you do is you click on

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.240
new session here. This is the only time

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.825
you'll have to do this. And, you can

00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:07.465
just use the regular defaults here and click

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.065
next and the host name is going to

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.265
be nif dot stanford dot edu. You can

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:14.825
leave the port the same, no firewall, and

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:18.160
then you type your username. Okay and that's

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.960
it and then for the secure FX protocol

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.400
that's fine too and then you can just

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.720
leave it at myth.stanford. If you want and

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.480
there you go. And if you double click

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.855
on that it'll bring it up the first

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.535
time, it will ask you if you want

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:32.975
to use this, you should say accept and

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.335
save and then it shouldn't ask you that

00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:37.855
again. If you type your password, it's, blocked

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:41.615
out with little dots and if you save

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.135
it, it'll save it. I don't know if

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:44.975
it's the best idea to save it but

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.110
not not too bad probably if it's your

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.310
own computer. But that's that. Click okay and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.070
then it logs you in and much like

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.990
the other one we are here. Unfortunately, this

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.550
doesn't allow fancy colors it looks like, which

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.830
is too bad but you can still use

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.725
the clear, you can use the reset, the

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.525
CD command, LS command and so forth you

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:05.565
are logged on officially. And that's how you

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:07.165
do it. To log out just type log

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:10.125
out or control D and that's that. In

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.045
fact you are logged out when the little

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400
red minus here is there and then you

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.280
can just click actually I think we could

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.720
probably click, I'm not even sure, to get

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.680
back to the original maybe it's session manager,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.120
there we go. And if you want to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.539
click again you can just do that. So

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.699
that's that. How you log on. Thanks.
