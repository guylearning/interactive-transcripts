Hi there. In this video we are going

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.440
to look at the find command which is

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.560
used to find files inside a file system.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.040
So, it's actually really powerful if you were

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.520
like, why did I know that file exists

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:17.095
somewhere, so I'd better actually look for it.

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:18.535
Here's how it works, it's a little bit

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.455
strange the way it works, but what you

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:23.335
do is you type find and then you

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:25.255
type the directory you're in and if you

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:27.815
happen to wanna search from your current directory,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.415
you just type a period because that stands

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.550
for the current directory. Then you type dash

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.790
name if you're searching for a name. And

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.150
then in quotation marks, put the, file you're

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.390
looking for. So hello dot c for instance.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.110
Right? And if we type that, then, it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.390
should find all the instances of hello.c in

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.745
my file system from the current directory. So

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:50.185
in this case, there's a hello. C and

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:53.545
assign zero, assign one and assign five. So

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.145
you can do that and that makes it

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:57.065
pretty easy to do. You can also do

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:01.010
find dot dash name and then wildcards. These

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.530
are a little bit different than the gref

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.850
wildcards but this, the asterisk basically means find,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.410
any match and then period c will be

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.810
any dot c file and it would find

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.650
all those files and there are plenty of

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.025
them inside my folder here. Okay, so that's

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:26.185
how find works. It's relatively straightforward. Can instead

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.265
of dot you can put any directory, know,

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:31.770
you can search slash AFS slash IR slash

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.410
class slash CS 107 etcetera and then start

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.050
finding all the dot c files there. Okay,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.570
some of this stuff you probably don't have

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.805
access to because it's in staff, but you

00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:46.205
can do that, you can also search for

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:50.925
directories too. So let's find all the directories,

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:57.220
dot dash name dash, I think it's type

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.140
equals d for directory, I believe that's right.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.180
Actually, we're gonna need dot name and dash

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.020
name for just finding all the directories. I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.420
think that's it right there, maybe it's not.

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:17.065
Type, let's see, dash type, let's see, doesn't

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:19.785
actually seem to, I think maybe we do

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.505
it this way, dash type d like that,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.810
There we go. That'll find all the different

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.610
folders that we have, directories in this current

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.130
folder. So what if we wanna find, we

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.250
can still do dot dash name and assign

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.825
for instance, assign star let's say and this

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.825
will find all the directories that start with

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:43.425
assign star. If I happen to have files

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:44.945
that start with assign star it would ignore

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:48.785
those. So, find is a very, interesting command.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.230
If you want to do some other command

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.750
on each file, you can also do that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.030
with a command called exe c, which is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.350
a flag. Like it would be something like

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.705
this, dash name, assign star, dash type d

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.265
and then dash e x e c and

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:09.625
it takes a little bit of time to

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:10.745
get used to how e x e c

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:14.745
works but it actually runs a particular command

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:16.345
that you want like let's do an l

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.450
s on all those directories and then you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.890
have to put weird brackets like this and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.530
some other weird incantations but it will actually

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.530
list for you all of the it will

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.530
actually run that command, the l s command

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.610
in this case, on all of the matches

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.900
that it found. So that's how this this

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.700
actually works. Okay. That's the find command. Thanks.
