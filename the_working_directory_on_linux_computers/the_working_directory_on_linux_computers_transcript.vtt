00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.680
Hi there. This video is going to be

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.680
about the idea of a working directory, which

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.560
you will find useful when you are running

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.955
your programs in CS one zero seven. The

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:17.035
working directory is representation of where your program

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:20.475
starts looking for files. So when you're running

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.795
a program, it actually has a certain location

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.760
that it looks for the files in. Often,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.160
this is actually where you launch the application

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.320
from. So you're in a particular directory, you

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.160
run your program, and that directory is where

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.665
the working directory is. This is not necessarily

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:46.785
where the program itself lives. So, for instance,

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.305
if I, run the command l s, well

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:52.705
the l s program lives in some other

00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:54.145
folder. In fact, can figure out where it

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:56.140
lives. Which l s tells us that l

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.620
it the l s command lives in slash

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.100
bin slash l s. But in this case,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.300
the working directory is my home folder here.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.220
So if I type l s, well, it's

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.140
gonna do an l s of the files

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.805
in my home folder. Okay. So, if you

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.205
wanna figure out what your working directory is,

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:17.685
you can actually type p w d, which

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.725
says print working directory and that will actually

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:22.885
tell you that this is the directory that

00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:25.445
that things will start looking for files in.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.630
Okay. If you change to another directory, so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.990
let's say we change to c s one

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.590
zero seven slash assignments slash assign zero. Okay.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.430
P w d says oh good look now

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.670
we're in the working directory is now the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.095
entire directory out to assign zero. Okay? I

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:44.655
happen to have the hello program here and

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:47.935
remember, from a different video on the file

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:50.575
system, you can, you run a program by

00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:53.935
saying what folder it's in and dot slash

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:58.410
hello means the current directory hello program. So

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.050
it will run hello world like that and

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.610
it didn't happen to read anything in but

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.450
the working directory is the assigned zero directory.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.970
Now, I can actually go back to two

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.645
directories back if I want and I can

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.525
actually run hello from here if I want

00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:19.325
to. Have to type the path from here.

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:26.330
So let's see, if I type assignments slash

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.770
assign zero slash hello then the working directory

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.770
is the current directory I'm in but hello

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.530
is located in a different place. Now it's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.050
still gonna print hello world because it doesn't

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.305
have to actually read any information in, but,

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:42.945
but that's that. So you will find that

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.985
sometimes you your programs can't find the right

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.785
files. Just make sure that you understand where

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:51.665
they're looking and often that is the working

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:53.105
directory. Thanks.
